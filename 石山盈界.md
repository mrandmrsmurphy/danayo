### Source:

Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45

> "As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces... But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth." (Dan 2:34-35, ESV) "And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed." (Dan 2:44, ESV)

### Examples:

- 神国如石山盈界,終必勝万邦。(God's kingdom is like the stone-mountain filling the world; it will ultimately triumph over all nations.)
- 基督之国始雖小,終石山盈界,無有窮尽。(Christ's kingdom though small at first, will ultimately become a stone-mountain filling the world, without end.)

### Cultural Notes:

石山盈界 captures the prophetic climax of Nebuchadnezzar's dream: the stone "cut out by no human hand" (representing God's kingdom) crushes the statue of human empires and grows into a mountain filling the entire earth. 石 (stone) emphasizes the divine origin and indestructibility; 山 (mountain) conveys permanence and sovereignty; 盈界 (fills-the-world) expresses universal dominion. This is a foundational messianic prophecy for Christians, seeing Christ's kingdom as the eternal reign that supplants all earthly powers.

### Sentiment:

Triumphant, eschatological, hope-filled. Used to express the ultimate victory and universal scope of God's kingdom, or the inexorable growth of divine purpose.
