## Notes
- [[Radical 031|囗]] + [[人 (char)|儿]] = [[SKIP-3-3-2]] ([[Stroke 05]])
- The word "four" was written as 亖 (sǐ) before Western Zhou and 四 (sì) appeared in late Spring and Autumn period. This alternative form was used to prevent confusion of 亖 (sǐ) and 二 (“two”) or 三 (“three”) in vertical writing. It was standardized in Qin dynasty.  The bronzeware style of the character featured a repositioning of those four lines inside 口 (kǒu); this later evolved into the combination used today of 口 (kǒu, “mouth”) and 八 (bā, “divide”) which meant a dispersal of breath. It could thus be said that four is a borrowed meaning for this character. The original sense is preserved in 呬 (OC \*hrids), by adding an extra 口. Compare this character with 只 and 曰.

- The anti-forgery 'four' is [[肆]].
- In order to keep the ancient Far Eastern symbolism of 'four' being homophonous with 'death', the Korean pronunciation as 사 was *not* adopted for this character.
