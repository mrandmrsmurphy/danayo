# Notes
Rivers are difficult to achieve consensus on.  Koreans use [[江]] as the default word, though many places have 川 in the name.  In Japan, everything is a 川.  But in China, [[河]] is common.  Vietnamese has a native word, but 江 is listed as the old spelling.  This character was chosen because it is so easy, while 江 takes the Japanese meaning of cove/inlet.  Swadesh 152
