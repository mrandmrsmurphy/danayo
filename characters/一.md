<ruby>一<rt>읻</rt></ruby> is probably the first character most people learn.  It is the easiest.  It is the first radical in the Kangxi system (see there for more details).  Dan'a'yo has sixteen other characters under that heading, though none of them are derived from this one.  <ruby>戌<rt>숟</rt></ruby> and <ruby>乞<rt>킫</rt></ruby> are perhaps the only characters visually and phonetically derived from it.  As a <ruby>象形<rt>샹헝</rt></ruby>/pictogram, it is not based on any other character.  In compounds, it appears in many, many words.  To disambiguate various numbers, it is sometimes put in front of 溝, 兆, 億, 万, 千, 百, 十, or 半.
