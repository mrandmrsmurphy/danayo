# Notes
This obscure character is on both the [[Jinmeiyō|Japanese name-only list]] and the [[Korean Name ㅎ|Korean]].  It is not found in the HSK.  It is self-evidently [[木]] + [[会 (char)]].  It was also pronounced /kuɑt/ in MC.  It was accepted into <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> because, while similar in sound to 會 in MC (huɑi vs kuɑi), it is now very different (hwe vs gwai).
## Definition (Name Character)
- Chinese juniper --> [[伊吹]]
- Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) -> [[檜木]]
