From a story in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals

**Literal:** “Carve a mark on a boat to seek a sword.”  
**Figurative meaning:** To stick rigidly to a method despite changed circumstances; foolish consistency; ignoring context.

- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** hak1 zau1 kau4 gim3

## Source / Origin
- 《呂氏春秋·察今》 “Lüshi Chunqiu – ‘Examining the Present’.”  
    A man drops his sword into a river from a moving boat. He carves a notch on the boat’s gunwale to mark the spot, intending to retrieve it later when the boat stops—failing to realize the boat has moved while the sword remained where it fell.    
## Usage
- Often used to criticize approaches that ignore changing conditions, data, or context.
## Example
- 當市場環境劇變而仍沿用舊方案，無異於刻舟求劍。  
    _When the market changes dramatically yet you keep using the old plan, it’s just like “carving the boat to seek the sword.”_
