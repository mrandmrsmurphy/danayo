### Source / Origin

The idiom _貪官汚吏_ emerged during the **Tang dynasty**, combining two pejorative titles for corrupt officials:

- **貪官** (_greedy official_): one who enriches himself through bribes and extortion.
    
- **汚吏** (_filthy clerk_): literally “unclean scribe,” denoting a petty bureaucrat who sullies justice.
    

The expression became prominent in **Song and Ming** moral literature and in the **imperial censorate’s memorials**, where upright ministers decried moral decay in governance.  
It encapsulates the perennial theme of Chinese political ethics: **when virtue fails at the top, corruption spreads through the realm.**

The Tang poet **Bai Juyi (白居易)** wrote scathingly of such men:

> 貪吏得寵亂法度，貧人有冤無處訴。  
> _When corrupt officials are favored, the laws are in ruin;  
> the poor have wrongs but nowhere to appeal._

Later, **Zhu Xi (朱熹)** used the term to warn that moral rot among minor clerks destroys the Mandate of Heaven (_天命_).

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_貪官汚吏_ is more than a political insult — it is a **moral indictment within the Confucian universe**, where the legitimacy of rule depends on virtue (_德政_).

In **Confucian thought**, government is a moral institution:

> 為政以德，譬如北辰，居其所而眾星共之。  
> _To govern by virtue is like the North Star — it remains in place, and all stars revolve around it._ (_Analects_, 2:1)

When officials pursue private gain (_貪_) instead of public duty (_義_), the cosmic harmony between Heaven and humanity collapses.  
Hence, the phrase _貪官汚吏_ represents **the inversion of the Mandate of Heaven**, a sign of dynastic decline.

In **Daoist commentary**, corruption arises when rulers cling to form and hierarchy rather than simplicity and the Dao.  
In **Buddhist ethics**, such officials accrue _karmic debt_ for causing the suffering of the innocent — a defilement not only of law but of the heart.

Thus, the idiom became a **moral archetype** in Chinese literature — the foil against which upright officials (_清官 qīng guān_) like **Bao Zheng (包拯)** or **Hai Rui (海瑞)** are celebrated.

### Usage Across Cultures

Still widely used in journalism and political speech to denounce corruption.

**Japanese:**  
たんかんおり (_tankan ori_) appears in historical and literary contexts, often in discussions of premodern bureaucracy or as a moral epithet.

> たんかんおりの横行は、国を滅ぼす。  
> _The rampancy of corrupt officials destroys the nation._

**Korean:**  
탐관오리 (_tamgwan ori_) is a fixed phrase in both history books and modern political rhetoric.

> 조선 말기의 탐관오리들이 민심을 잃게 했다.  
> _The corrupt officials of late Joseon lost the people’s trust._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Tham quan ô lại_ remains a vivid idiom in politics and literature, synonymous with oppression and decay.

> Tham quan ô lại làm dân oán trời than đất.  
> _Greedy officials make the people curse Heaven and Earth._
