# 吳越同舟 (吴越同舟)

**Literal meaning:** “Wu and Yue in the same boat.”  
**Figurative meaning:** “Enemies sharing a common fate; rivals cooperating in adversity.”

### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** wú yuè tóng zhōu    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** ng4 jyut6 tung4 zau1    
- **Korean:** 오월동주 (_owol dongju_)    
- **Japanese:** ごえつどうしゅう (_goetsu dōshū_)    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** Ngô Việt đồng chu    

### Variants
- **Simplified / Traditional:** 吴越同舟 / 吳越同舟    
- **Related idioms:**    
    - 同舟共濟 (_to cross the river together in one boat; to work together in difficulty_)        
    - 化敵為友 (_to turn enemies into friends_)        
    - 患難與共 (_to share hardship together_)        
    - 齊心協力 (_to unite and work as one_)        
- **Poetic variant:** 吳楚同舟 (_Wu and Chu in the same boat_), used in some Tang-era verse.    

### Source / Origin
The idiom originates from the _Warring States period_ text **《孫子兵法·九地篇》** (_The Art of War_, “On the Nine Grounds”), traditionally attributed to **Sunzi (Sun Tzu)**:

> 故吳人與越人相惡也，當其同舟而濟於江，則相救如左右手。  
> _Thus, though the men of Wu and Yue hate each other, when they are crossing the river together in the same boat, they will save one another as if their own hands and feet._

This line draws on the historical enmity between the **states of Wu (吳)** and **Yue (越)**, fierce rivals in the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period. Yet, when caught in the same peril — a storm at sea — even bitter enemies instinctively cooperate to survive.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

At its heart, _吳越同舟_ conveys a **moral of necessity and solidarity**: that shared danger dissolves division.

In **Confucian ethics**, it reflects the pragmatic virtue of _ren_ (仁, humaneness) and _yi_ (義, righteousness) that transcends rivalry when life and duty are at stake.

In **Daoist terms**, it illustrates the fluid balance of opposites: even antagonistic forces can harmonize under pressure — _the soft and hard, the enemy and ally, flow together like water in the same vessel._

In **Buddhist interpretation**, it can be read allegorically: all sentient beings share the same “boat of existence” (生死之舟) and must cooperate on the path to liberation.

Over time, the idiom’s sense broadened from literal survival to a **metaphor for political alliances, teamwork, or temporary cooperation among rivals.**

### Usage Across Cultures

**Modern Chinese:**  
Used to describe people or groups who must cooperate despite rivalry, especially in crisis.

> 雖然他們平時競爭激烈，但在危難之時也能吳越同舟。  
> _Though they usually compete fiercely, in times of trouble they can still unite like Wu and Yue in the same boat._

**Japanese:**  
ごえつどうしゅう (_goetsu dōshū_) is used in both historical writing and metaphorical contexts — for uneasy alliances or pragmatic cooperation.

> 敵対する二国が、今はごえつどうしゅうの関係にある。  
> _The two rival nations now find themselves in the same boat._

**Korean:**  
오월동주 (_owol dongju_) appears frequently in journalism and political commentary to describe **unlikely cooperation** or **coalitions of convenience**.

> 여야는 오월동주의 처지에 놓였다.  
> _The ruling and opposition parties are now like Wu and Yue in the same boat._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Ngô Việt đồng chu_ retains its classical form in literature and proverbs, meaning “enemies joined by fate.”

> Trong cơn hoạn nạn, kẻ thù cũng Ngô Việt đồng chu.  
> _In hardship, even foes share the same boat._

### Example Usage
1. **Chinese:**  
    吳越同舟，方知禍福相倚。  
    _When Wu and Yue share one boat, fortune and misfortune depend on each other._    
2. **Japanese:**  
    ごえつどうしゅうの政党連立が成立した。  
    _A coalition government — strange bedfellows in the same boat — has been formed._   

### Sentiment
> “Rivals bound by circumstance — the storm makes brothers of foes.”
