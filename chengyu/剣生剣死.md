### Source:

Matthew 26:52

> "Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'" (Matt 26:52, ESV)

### Examples:

- 暴君剣生剣死,終遭反噬。(The tyrant lived by the sword and died by the sword, ultimately suffering reversal.)
- 基督教人勿剣生剣死,当以和平待人。(Christ teaches people not to live by the sword and die by the sword, but to treat others with peace.)

### Cultural Notes:

The parallel structure (sword-live/sword-die) creates a chiastic balance emphasizing the principle of reciprocal violence. Jesus spoke these words when Peter drew his sword to defend him in Gethsemane, teaching that violence begets violence. This proverb expresses the Biblical principle that those who resort to violence will ultimately fall victim to it—a warning against vengeance and militarism.

### Sentiment:

Cautionary, karmic. Used to warn against violence, express the inevitability of retribution, or describe the self-destructive nature of aggression.
