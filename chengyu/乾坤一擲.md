### Source / Origin
The phrase originates from **Tang dynasty poetry**, where it first appeared in a famous verse by **Li Bai (李白)**:
> 《擲地金聲曲》：“我願乾坤一擲，換得君王笑。”  
> _“I would cast heaven and earth in one throw, if it could win the emperor’s smile.”_
Here, Li Bai used the expression hyperbolically — comparing his fate to gambling with the cosmos itself, risking everything for imperial favor.

By the **Song** and **Ming** periods, **乾坤一擲** evolved into a general metaphor for taking **an ultimate risk** — whether in battle, politics, business, or life decisions.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Suggests courage, decisiveness, and fate-defying audacity — though with a hint of recklessness.    
- **Japanese:** _乾坤一擲 (kenkon itteki)_ became a popular idiom in military rhetoric, meaning “a do-or-die gamble,” especially during the Meiji and wartime eras.    
- **Korean:** _건곤일척_ is a common _사자성어_ meaning “a single, decisive gamble,” often used in political or sports commentary.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Càn khôn nhất trịch_ keeps the same dramatic sense — “a heaven-and-earth gamble.”    

The phrase’s grandeur comes from juxtaposing **乾坤 (heaven and earth)** — the whole universe — with **一擲 (one throw)**, symbolizing total commitment or existential risk.

### Example Usage

這一場戰役，是我軍的乾坤一擲。

### Sentiment

> **“To risk the whole universe on one throw — to give all for a single, decisive chance.”**

A phrase that mingles **heroic daring** and **existential fatalism**, echoing both classical valor and the courage of faith — much like “If I perish, I perish” (Esther 4:16) in biblical tone.
