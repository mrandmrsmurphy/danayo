# 粉骨碎身 / 粉骨砕身
**Literal meaning:** “To grind one’s bones to powder and shatter one’s body.”  
**Figurative meaning:** To devote oneself utterly; to sacrifice one’s life for duty, gratitude, or righteousness.
### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** fěn gǔ suì shēn (3–3–4–1)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** fan5 gwat1 seoi3 san1    
- **Korean:** 분골쇄신 (粉骨碎身)     
- **Japanese:** ふんこつさいしん（粉骨砕身）_funkotsu saishin_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** phấn cốt toái thân    
### Variants
- **Traditional:** 粉骨碎身    
- **Simplified (Mainland):** 粉身碎骨    
- **Japanese orthography:** 粉骨砕身    
- All variants share the same meaning; only word order differs slightly.    
- Related idioms:    
    - **粉身碎骨** – literally reversed, but identical in sense.        
    - **肝腦塗地** – “to spill one’s liver and brains upon the ground,” another hyperbolic form of loyalty or sacrifice.        
### Source / Origin

The expression descends from classical Chinese poetic and Buddhist diction.  
Two key sources:
1. **《明·于謙〈石灰吟〉》 (Yu Qian, _Ode to Lime_, Ming dynasty):**    
    > “粉骨碎身全不怕，要留清白在人間。”  
    > _‘I fear not to have my bones ground or body broken — only to leave my purity in the world.’_  
    > Yu Qian, a loyal Ming minister executed unjustly, used this line to symbolize **unyielding integrity even unto death.**    
2. **Buddhist sutra imagery**, where self-sacrifice for compassion or enlightenment is described in similar terms — _“願粉骨碎身以報佛恩”_ (“I would gladly be ground to dust to repay the Buddha’s grace”).    

Thus the phrase came to mean **total devotion to a cause**, whether moral, political, or spiritual.
### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** A literary or moral idiom denoting selfless loyalty — to one’s ruler, parents, or moral duty.    
- **Japanese:** _粉骨砕身_ is still common, meaning “to work oneself to the bone” or “devote oneself wholeheartedly.”    
    - Modern Japanese usage can be less literal, e.g. “I’ll do my utmost” (_粉骨砕身の努力_).        
- **Korean:** _분골쇄신_ carries the classical meaning of sacrificial loyalty but also the modern sense of “utmost effort.”    
- **Vietnamese:** _Phấn cốt toái thân_ appears in poetry and classical education, meaning “utter devotion to repay grace.”    
### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
願為國家粉骨碎身，無怨無悔。  
_I am willing to be crushed to dust for my country, with no regrets._

**Japanese:**  
彼は粉骨砕身の努力をした。  
_He worked with wholehearted devotion (literally, “to the breaking of his bones”)._

**Korean:**  
나라를 위해 분골쇄신하겠다.  
_I will sacrifice myself completely for the nation._

**Vietnamese:**  
Nguyện phấn cốt toái thân để báo ơn cha mẹ.  
_I vow to crush my bones and body to repay my parents’ grace._
### Sentiment
> **“To give oneself wholly, even unto destruction, in loyalty, gratitude, or righteousness.”**

A phrase of tragic nobility — conveying the _Confucian martyr’s heart_, the _Buddhist bodhisattva’s vow_, and, in translation, the _Christian sense of laying down one’s life for love._
