### Source / Origin

The expression descends from classical Chinese poetic and Buddhist diction.  
Two key sources:
1. **《明·于謙〈石灰吟〉》 (Yu Qian, _Ode to Lime_, Ming dynasty):**    
    > “粉骨碎身全不怕，要留清白在人間。”  
    > _‘I fear not to have my bones ground or body broken — only to leave my purity in the world.’_  
    > Yu Qian, a loyal Ming minister executed unjustly, used this line to symbolize **unyielding integrity even unto death.**    
2. **Buddhist sutra imagery**, where self-sacrifice for compassion or enlightenment is described in similar terms — _“願粉骨碎身以報佛恩”_ (“I would gladly be ground to dust to repay the Buddha’s grace”).    

Thus the phrase came to mean **total devotion to a cause**, whether moral, political, or spiritual.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** A literary or moral idiom denoting selfless loyalty — to one’s ruler, parents, or moral duty.    
- **Japanese:** _粉骨砕身_ is still common, meaning “to work oneself to the bone” or “devote oneself wholeheartedly.”    
    - Modern Japanese usage can be less literal, e.g. “I’ll do my utmost” (_粉骨砕身の努力_).        
- **Korean:** _분골쇄신_ carries the classical meaning of sacrificial loyalty but also the modern sense of “utmost effort.”    
- **Vietnamese:** _Phấn cốt toái thân_ appears in poetry and classical education, meaning “utter devotion to repay grace.”

### Sentiment
> **“To give oneself wholly, even unto destruction, in loyalty, gratitude, or righteousness.”**

A phrase of tragic nobility — conveying the _Confucian martyr’s heart_, the _Buddhist bodhisattva’s vow_, and, in translation, the _Christian sense of laying down one’s life for love._
