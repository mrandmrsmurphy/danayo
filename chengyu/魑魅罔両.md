### Source / Origin

The earliest reference is in the **《山海經》 (Classic of Mountains and Seas)** and **《左傳·宣公三年》**, where these names describe specific **nature spirits** inhabiting mountains, rivers, and marshes:

> 「山林川谷，丘陵坻障，魑魅魍魎，莫能逢之。」  
> _“In the mountains and rivers, hills and marshes dwell the demons and spirits — invisible and innumerable.”_

In **ancient Chinese cosmology**, every natural feature had its spiritual counterpart —

- **魑魅** were said to haunt mountains and forests,
    
- **魍魎** were the spirits of water and mists.
    

Over time, the four names became a fixed collocation meaning _“all the unclean spirits,”_ and later metaphorically _“all corrupt or evil beings.”_


### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

- **Early Religion:** In shamanic and Daoist belief, these spirits symbolized nature’s hidden dangers — the unseen energies that cause disease or delusion.
    
- **Confucian Political Ethics:** The term came to describe _wicked courtiers and flatterers_ who “bewitch the ruler.”
    
    > “除去魑魅魍魎，使天下清明。”  
    > _“Expel the demons and monsters, and the world will be pure again.”_
    
- **Literary:** By the Tang–Song period, used to dramatize moral chaos or supernatural horror.


### Usage Across Cultures

- **Chinese:** Figuratively for corruption, deceit, or malicious intrigue.
    
    - “要肅清政壇上的魑魅魍魎。”  
        _“We must purge the political scene of its demons and monsters.”_
        
- **Japanese:** _魑魅魍魎 (chimi mōryō)_ is common in folklore, yokai literature, and moral metaphor — “all manner of ghosts and monsters.”
    
- **Korean:** _치매망량_ appears in classical texts; now mainly literary.
    
- **Vietnamese:** _Si mị vọng lượng_ appears in translations of _Shan Hai Jing_ or _Zuo Zhuan_, meaning the spirits of nature.


### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
世間魑魅魍魎，唯正道可鎮。  
_Among all the demons of the world, only the righteous Way can subdue them._

**Japanese:**  
政治の世界には魑魅魍魎がうごめく。  
_In the world of politics, monsters and demons writhe about._

**Korean:**  
세상에는 치매망량이 가득하다.  
_The world is full of deceitful demons._

**Vietnamese:**  
Trần thế đầy si mị vọng lượng, chỉ có chính đạo mới trấn áp được.  
_The world is filled with evil spirits; only the true Way can subdue them._


### Sentiment

> **“All the lurking demons — the unseen powers of corruption, deceit, and chaos.”**

From a cosmological view, it symbolizes **the dark underside of the Dao**,  
and from a moral view, **the corruption of human hearts** —  
those “demons within” that must be expelled to restore harmony.
