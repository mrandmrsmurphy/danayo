>[!Tip] The guiding principle of [[文法 - 02音韻論]]

# 朝鮮正音

## Literal meaning
“Joseon selects the correct sounds.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle that a shared East Asian auxiliary language may ground its phonology in the historically central and systematized sound values of Middle Korean. The idiom asserts phonological choice as an act of clarity and intentional design rather than political preference, emphasizing regularity, learnability, and recoverable historical structure. In this sense, sound is not inherited passively but chosen deliberately.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** cháo xiǎn zhèng yīn
- **Cantonese:** ciu4 sin2 zing3 jam1
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** ちょうせんせいおん
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 조선정음 (jo-seon jeong-eum)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** triều tiên chính âm

## Notes on scope and tone
朝鮮正音 is both technical and commemorative. It consciously echoes **訓民正音**, the 1446 proclamation of **世宗大王** of the **朝鮮王朝**, while extending its logic beyond national reform to civilizational design. The idiom frames phonology as a normative choice made in service of intelligibility and shared heritage.
