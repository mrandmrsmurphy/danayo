### Source / Origin
The phrase is a classical compound of two binary pairs — _古今_ (“ancient and modern”) and _東西_ (“east and west”) — both deeply rooted in early Chinese cosmology and historiography.

Earliest attestations of _古今_ appear in the _Zhuangzi_ (《莊子·天下》):

> 古今一也。  
> _The ancient and the present are one._

Similarly, _東西_ (East and West) was an established cosmographic pair since the _Book of Documents_ (《書經》):

> 東西南北，惟時之序。  
> _East, west, south, and north—each follows its appointed order._

The compound _古今東西_ became common in Tang and Song prose to denote universality. Han Yu (韓愈) and later Zhu Xi (朱熹) used it to express truths or values valid across time and space.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_古今東西_ epitomizes the Chinese philosophical instinct toward **totality and harmony** — a vision that transcends boundaries of **time** (_古今_) and **space** (_東西_).

In **Confucian thought**, it echoes the universality of _li_ (理) — the cosmic principle present “throughout all ages and realms.” What was right for the ancients remains right for today, though its expression may vary.

In **Daoist language**, it resonates with the unity of the _Dao_, which flows through all directions and times: “The ten thousand things return to one.”

In **Buddhism**, the phrase approximates the Mahāyāna view of “non-obstruction between past and present worlds” — all dharmas interpenetrate across temporal and spatial planes.

Thus, _古今東西_ embodies **universality, timelessness, and the common thread of truth across humanity.**

### Usage Across Cultures

In **modern Chinese**, the idiom often introduces sweeping comparisons or universal truths:

> 古今東西，愛情皆難。  
> _In all times and places, love is hard._

In **Japanese**, 古今東西 (_kokontōzai_) carries nearly identical usage — a rhetorical preface meaning “throughout the world and all ages,” often in academic or literary writing.

> 古今東西の詩人が愛を詠んだ。  
> _Poets of all ages and lands have sung of love._

In **Korean**, 고금동서 appears in learned prose, sermons, or essays to imply universality:

> 고금동서를 막론하고, 진리는 하나이다.  
> _In all times and places, truth is one._

In **Vietnamese**, _cổ kim đông tây_ serves the same function in moral discourse or essays:

> Cổ kim đông tây, lòng người chẳng đổi.  
> _Across time and continents, the human heart remains the same._

### Example Usage

1. **Chinese:**  
    古今東西，善惡之理不變。  
    _In all times and places, the principles of good and evil do not change._
    
2. **Japanese:**  
    古今東西の英雄は、時代を超えて語り継がれる。  
    _Heroes of all ages and lands are remembered beyond their time._

### Cross-Cultural Parallel

In the **Western philosophical tradition**, _古今東西_ parallels the idea of _universalia_ — truths valid in all places and times. It echoes Saint Augustine’s _veritas una et eadem est ubique et semper_ (“truth is one and the same everywhere and always”).

Both traditions affirm a moral and metaphysical continuity transcending the flux of history.
