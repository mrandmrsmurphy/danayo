### Source:

Exodus 20:9-10, Deuteronomy 5:13-14

> "Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work." (Ex 20:9-10, ESV)

### Examples:

- 神命六作一止,使人得安息敬拝。(God commanded six [days] work, one [day] rest, so that people might have rest and worship.)
- 守安息日者行六作一止之律,記念創造之工。(Those who keep the Sabbath follow the law of six work, one rest, commemorating the work of creation.)

### Cultural Notes:

六作一止 compresses the Sabbath commandment into elegant balance: six units of work (作) followed by one unit of cessation (止). This rhythm mirrors God's own pattern in creation (Genesis 2:2-3) and establishes a weekly cycle of labor and sacred rest. 止 (stop/cease) emphasizes complete cessation from work, not merely reduced activity. The Sabbath principle extends beyond mere rest to include worship, remembrance of God's creative and redemptive work, and trust in divine provision. This pattern influenced both Jewish and Christian practice, though applied differently in each tradition.

### Sentiment:

Prescriptive, rhythmic, restorative. Used to express the pattern of work and rest, the discipline of Sabbath-keeping, or the divine rhythm of labor and worship.
