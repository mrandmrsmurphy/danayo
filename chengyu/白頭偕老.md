### Source / Origin

The phrase originates in **Han–Jin dynasty love poetry** and early marriage inscriptions.  
Its most famous early occurrence is in **《詩經·邶風·擊鼓》**, where a soldier vows:

> 「死生契闊，與子成說；執子之手，與子偕老。」  
> _“Through life and death, union or separation, I have pledged with you:  
> holding your hand, I will grow old with you.”_

From this line, the expression **偕老 (grow old together)** and the image of **白頭 (white-headed)** merged into the formula **白頭偕老**.  
By the Tang and Song periods, it became the standard poetic blessing for marriage.
