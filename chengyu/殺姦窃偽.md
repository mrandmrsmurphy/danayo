### Source:

Exodus 20:13-16, Deuteronomy 5:17-20

> "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." (Ex 20:13-16, ESV)

### Examples:

- 神禁殺姦窃偽,立人倫之基。(God forbids murder, adultery, theft, and lying, establishing the foundation of human ethics.)
- 守法者避殺姦窃偽,行義於世。(Those who keep the law avoid murder, adultery, theft, and lying, practicing righteousness in the world.)

### Cultural Notes:

This remarkably compact phrase captures four consecutive commandments from the Decalogue. 殺 (murder/kill), 姦 (adultery/sexual immorality), 窃 (theft/stealing), and 偽 (falsehood/lying) represent fundamental violations of human dignity and social order. These prohibitions protect life, marriage, property, and truth—the foundational structures of just society. The four-character compression makes this particularly memorable and demonstrates how Biblical law addresses both vertical obligations (to God) and horizontal obligations (to neighbor). These prohibitions are nearly universal across ethical systems.

### Sentiment:

Prohibitive, ethical, foundational. Used to reference core moral law, condemn fundamental wrongdoing, or establish the baseline of righteous conduct.
