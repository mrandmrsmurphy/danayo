## Classical Sources

The word **瞭然** itself is old. It appears in Buddhist Chinese translations and Tang prose meaning “clear, bright, transparent.”

- **《世說新語·言語》** (compiled 5th c.) has:
    
    > “王夷甫神識清澄，**瞭然**自得。”  
    > (Wang Yifu’s mind was lucid, clearly at ease.)
    
- **宋代**:  
    In Zhu Xi’s writings, e.g. **《朱子語類》**:
    
    > “聖賢之言，昭然瞭然，無一毫隱晦。”  
    > (The words of the sages are radiant and clear, without the slightest obscurity.)
    

As for the _exact phrase_:

- The compact four-character form **一目瞭然** seems to first crystallize in **Ming–Qing vernacular literature**, where we see lines like:
    
    - **《醒世恆言》卷二十三** (Ming): “這事一目瞭然，何必多言。”
        
    - Meaning: “This matter is clear at a glance, no need for many words.”
        

So it’s a later crystallized idiom, but built on classical vocabulary.
