# 種瓜得瓜

**Literal meaning:** “Plant melons, get melons.”  
**Extended sense:** One reaps what one sows; outcomes follow causes; actions reliably produce corresponding results.

**Source:** Commonly traced to **《南史》** 卷六十四, **陸澄傳**. In that historiographical setting, the phrase functions as a moral explanation of consequences rather than as a proverbial flourish.

**Classical background:**  
The structure is starkly causal. There is no metaphorical leap beyond agriculture itself. Unlike later moral aphorisms that invoke Heaven, fate, or retribution, 種瓜得瓜 grounds moral reasoning in ordinary experience. The logic is observational rather than theological. Planting determines harvest.

The idiom is also notable for what it omits. There is no explicit judgment, no praise or blame. The moral force lies in inevitability. Actions contain their outcomes implicitly, and time merely reveals what was already set in motion.

**Modern usage:**  
Throughout the region, the expression is used to underscore responsibility and predictability. It appears in ethical discussion, education, parenting, and everyday explanation of success or failure. The tone can be neutral, admonitory, or consolatory, depending on context, but the logic remains matter-of-fact.

**Usage note:**  
種信得信, 種豆得豆, and similar variants circulate alongside 種瓜得瓜, but this form remains the most concrete and least moralized. Its durability comes from its refusal to argue. It simply points to the field and the harvest.
