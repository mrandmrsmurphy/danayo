> "When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God." (Ex 31:18, ESV)

### Examples:
- 神以指記二碑,示其律永恒不変。(God with his finger inscribed the two tablets, showing that his law is eternally unchanging.)
- 摩西受指記二碑於西乃山。(Moses received the two tablets inscribed by the finger [of God] at Mount Sinai.)

### Cultural Notes:
指記 (finger-inscribed) captures the Biblical detail that the tablets were "written with the finger of God" (Exodus 31:18), emphasizing divine authorship rather than human agency. 碑 (stele/tablet) is chosen over 版 (tablet/plate) for its monumental, enduring connotations. The phrase evokes both the physical object and the comprehensive moral law it represents—commonly understood as the Ten Commandments divided across two tablets.

### Sentiment:
Reverent, foundational. Used to reference divine law, covenant, or authoritative moral standards.
