**Literal meaning:** “Chu songs on all four sides.”  
**Extended sense:** To be completely surrounded by enemies; isolated with no allies or escape; besieged both physically and psychologically.

**Source:** From **《史記》·項羽本紀**, written by **司馬遷**, describing the final predicament of **項羽** at Gaixia.

### Classical background
The phrase refers to the famous stratagem in which Han forces, having encircled Xiang Yu’s army, sang Chu songs through the night. Hearing his homeland’s music from every direction, Xiang Yu believed Chu had already fallen and that he was utterly alone. The tactic combined military encirclement with psychological warfare, breaking morale before battle.

What makes 四面楚歌 enduring is that it names not just physical siege but existential isolation. The enemy is everywhere, and even familiar sounds confirm defeat. The phrase compresses geography, culture, and emotion into a single image.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 四面楚歌 is used metaphorically to describe situations of total opposition or abandonment. It appears in political analysis, workplace conflict, personal narrative, and historical commentary. The tone is grave and dramatic, often implying inevitability or impending collapse.

### Usage note
