The guiding maxim for social order in Dan’a’yo is **【選士唯賢】** (“Select men solely by merit”). This motto articulates a vision of community grounded in **virtue and ability rather than birth or privilege**.

Two principles flow from this maxim:

1. **擢用在賢** — promotion depends on worthiness: those of proven talent and virtue should be raised.
    
2. **權勢不容** — power and birth must not decide: inherited status is excluded as a basis for selection.
    

Thus **【選士唯賢】** affirms that the ideal community of Dan’a’yo is one of **meritocratic fairness**, echoing classical Confucian ideals while speaking to modern commitments to equity and capability.
