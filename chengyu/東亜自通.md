# 東亜自通

## Literal meaning
“East Asia communicates by itself.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle that East Asian languages and cultures possess sufficient shared structure, vocabulary, and literary heritage to enable direct mutual communication without mediation through external languages. The idiom affirms intra-regional intelligibility and cooperation grounded in common classical traditions, rather than reliance on English or other outside linguistic frameworks. In manifesto contexts, it frames an auxiliary language as a facilitating tool for exchange, not a replacement for native or literary languages.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** dōng yà zì tōng
- **Cantonese:** dung1 aa3 zi6 tung1
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** とうあじつう
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 동아자통 (dong-a ja-tong)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** đông á tự thông

## Notes on scope and tone
東亜自通 is civilizational and functional in scope. 自通 emphasizes endogenous connectivity rather than isolation, asserting that communication arises from shared inheritance rather than enforced uniformity. The tone is pragmatic and reflective, suitable for linguistic manifestos, prefaces, or design rationales for auxiliary languages. It implicitly contrasts auxiliary communication with native language life, preserving poetry, daily usage, and cultural expression within each community while highlighting a consciously maintained common medium.
