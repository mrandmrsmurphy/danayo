# 一刻千金

**Literal meaning:** “One quarter-hour is worth a thousand pieces of gold.”  
**Extended sense:** A brief moment is exceedingly precious; time, once lost, cannot be repurchased.

**Source:** Attributed to a poem by **蘇軾** (Su Shi) of the Northern Song dynasty. The line reflects a literati sensibility shared across the classical Sinitic world, where cultivated leisure, fleeting beauty, and moral urgency all converge on the value of time.

**Classical background:**  
The expression arises from a poetic context rather than bureaucratic prose, which matters. It is not about wages or accounting, but about heightened awareness. The “一刻” originally referred to a traditional time unit, roughly fifteen minutes. The exaggeration “千金” signals moral and aesthetic value, not literal price. Over time, the phrase detached from its poetic setting and became a general admonition against wasting time.

**Modern usage:**  
Used across CJKV languages to stress urgency, opportunity, or the irreplaceability of a moment. Common in educational, rhetorical, and even commercial contexts, often without conscious awareness of its Song-dynasty literary origin.
