### Examples:

- 人因罪受咒,地生荊棘荻蓬。(Humans because of sin received the curse; the earth produces thorns and thistles.)
- 労苦之人如耕荊棘荻蓬之地,終日辛苦。(Those who toil are like [those] plowing ground of thorns and thistles, laboring painfully all day.)

### Cultural Notes:

荊棘荻蓬 captures God's curse upon the ground after the Fall. 荊棘 (thorns/brambles) and 荻蓬 (thistles/weeds) represent the hostile, resistant nature of creation under curse—agriculture becomes painful toil rather than effortless provision. This phrase symbolizes the frustration and futility that entered the world through sin: human labor now struggles against a creation that resists and wounds. The imagery extends metaphorically to describe any difficult, painful, or cursed situation. In Christian theology, Christ's crown of thorns (Matthew 27:29) reverses this curse, as he bears the symbols of the curse upon himself.

### Sentiment:

Cursed, toilsome, frustrating. Used to describe difficult labor, cursed conditions, fallen creation, or the painful consequences of sin and judgment.
