- 神許以色列民乳蜜流地,示其豊饒祝福。(God promised the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey, showing abundant blessing.)

### Cultural Notes:

乳蜜流地 captures God's promise of Canaan to Israel—a metaphor for abundance, fertility, and divine provision. 流 (flowing) emphasizes overflowing prosperity rather than mere sufficiency. Milk represents pastoral wealth (livestock), while honey represents agricultural sweetness and natural abundance. This phrase became the archetypal description of the Promised Land and, by extension, any place of divinely-granted blessing and rest. In Christian theology, it also prefigures the heavenly kingdom—the ultimate promised land of God's people.

### Sentiment:

Hopeful, promissory, abundant. Used to describe promised blessing, divine provision, abundant prosperity, or the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.
