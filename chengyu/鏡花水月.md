# 鏡花水月 / 镜花水月

**Literal meaning:** “Flowers in a mirror and the moon reflected in water.”  
**Figurative meaning:** Something beautiful but intangible; an illusion, vision, or ideal that cannot be grasped.
### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** jìng huā shuǐ yuè (4–1–3–4)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** geng3 faa1 seoi2 jyut6    
- **Korean:** 경화수월 (鏡花水月)     
- **Japanese:** きょうかすいげつ（鏡花水月）_kyōka suigetsu_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** kính hoa thuỷ nguyệt    
### Variants
- Traditional: 鏡花水月    
- Simplified: 镜花水月    
- Poetic alternates: **水月鏡花**, **鏡裡觀花**, **水中撈月** (“grasping the moon in water,” very similar in imagery).    
### Source / Origin
The phrase originates from **Tang-dynasty** Buddhist and poetic literature.  
Earliest known use:
- **唐·張道陵《雲笈七籤》** and later **《楞嚴經》 commentaries** describe enlightenment and illusion using the metaphor:    
    > “見色如鏡中花，水中月。”  
    > _“To perceive form is like seeing flowers in a mirror, the moon in water.”_    

It became a stock metaphor in **Zen** for the _illusory nature of phenomena_ (空相 _śūnyatā_).  
By the **Song dynasty**, poets like **蘇軾 (Su Shi)** and **歐陽修 (Ouyang Xiu)** used it for fleeting beauty and unattainable ideals.
### Cultural & Aesthetic Meaning
- **Buddhist:** All appearances are transient and insubstantial — they reflect reality but are not themselves real.    
- **Poetic:** Beauty that exists only in perception — love, memory, fame, or dreams.    
- **Philosophical:** The boundary between illusion and truth; the paradox of perception.    
### Usage Across Cultures
- **Chinese:** Describes unreal beauty, false hope, or visionary ideals.    
    > “榮華富貴，如鏡花水月。”  
    > _“Glory and wealth are like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water.”_    
- **Japanese:** _鏡花水月 (kyōka suigetsu)_ became an _aesthetic ideal_ in Zen and art — beauty seen only in reflection, emphasizing ephemerality and perception.    
- **Korean:** _경화수월_ expresses unattainable beauty or ephemeral art.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Kính hoa thủy nguyệt_ carries the same sense — poetic illusion, dreamlike vision.    
### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
他對那段往事的記憶，如鏡花水月，一觸即散。  
_His memory of that past was like flowers in a mirror and the moon in water — vanishing at a touch._
**Japanese:**  
彼女の美しさは鏡花水月のようだ。  
_Her beauty is like flowers in a mirror, the moon in water._
**Korean:**  
그의 꿈은 경화수월이었다.  
_His dream was as unattainable as flowers in a mirror and the moon in water._
### Sentiment
> **“Visible yet untouchable; beautiful yet unreal.”**  
> A vision that reveals the truth of impermanence — _emptiness clothed in beauty._
