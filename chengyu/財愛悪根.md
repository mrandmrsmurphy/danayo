### Source:

1 Timothy 6:10

> "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs." (1 Tim 6:10, ESV)

### Examples:

- 財愛悪根,多人因此離道入迷。(The love of money is the root of evil; many people because of this leave the way and enter delusion.)
- 貪腐之官皆証財愛悪根之理。(Corrupt officials all prove the principle that the love of money is the root of evil.)

### Cultural Notes:

財愛 (money-love) precisely captures that it is not money itself but the love of it that is condemned. 悪根 (evil-root) uses the botanical metaphor of 根 (root) to indicate the source from which various evils spring. This distinction—between money and the love of money—is crucial to the Biblical text and preserved in the chengyu structure. The phrase resonates with East Asian Buddhist and Confucian warnings against attachment and greed.

### Sentiment:

Cautionary, moralistic. Used to warn against greed, materialism, or to explain moral corruption stemming from avarice.
