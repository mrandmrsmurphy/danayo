##  Classical Sources

The collocation appears in **pre-Qin texts**:

### 《荀子·王制》

> **春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏，萬物生長之時也。**  
> (In spring plowing, in summer weeding, in autumn harvesting, in winter storing up — these are the seasons when the myriad things are born and grow.)

Here, “万物生长” is explicitly tied to the rhythm of the seasons.
### 《淮南子·天文訓》

> 春分而後，天地氣交，**萬物生長。**  
> (After the spring equinox, heaven and earth’s vital energies intermingle, and all things grow.)

Another strong early occurrence, emphasizing the cosmological order.

### 《禮記·月令》

Also has parallel phrasing when describing seasonal ordinances, where **生长** is applied to myriad things in spring and summer.
## Later Usage

- By the Han and onward, **万物生长** became a set phrase in cosmological and poetic writing, though not always counted as a formal 成语.    
- Example: **唐詩** often echoes it in spring descriptions.    
- Modern: Still used, especially in seasonal prose or philosophy.    

E.g. Mao Zedong’s famous poem 《七律·读〈封建论〉呈郭老》 begins:

> _春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。_  
> (Not “万物生长” exactly, but shows the same classical diction. Another Mao poem, 《七律·长征》, has “万物生长靠太阳.”)

So the phrase stayed alive all the way into modern political poetry.
