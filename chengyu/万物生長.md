##  Classical Sources

The collocation appears in **pre-Qin texts**:

### 《荀子·王制》

> **春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏，萬物生長之時也。**  
> (In spring plowing, in summer weeding, in autumn harvesting, in winter storing up — these are the seasons when the myriad things are born and grow.)

Here, “万物生长” is explicitly tied to the rhythm of the seasons.
### 《淮南子·天文訓》

> 春分而後，天地氣交，**萬物生長。**  
> (After the spring equinox, heaven and earth’s vital energies intermingle, and all things grow.)

Another strong early occurrence, emphasizing the cosmological order.

### 《禮記·月令》

Also has parallel phrasing when describing seasonal ordinances, where **生长** is applied to myriad things in spring and summer.
## Later Usage

- By the Han and onward, **万物生长** became a set phrase in cosmological and poetic writing, though not always counted as a formal 成语.    
- Example: **唐詩** often echoes it in spring descriptions.    
- Modern: Still used, especially in seasonal prose or philosophy.    

E.g. Mao Zedong’s famous poem 《七律·读〈封建论〉呈郭老》 begins:

> _春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。_  
> (Not “万物生长” exactly, but shows the same classical diction. Another Mao poem, 《七律·长征》, has “万物生长靠太阳.”)

So the phrase stayed alive all the way into modern political poetry.

# 萬物生長 / 万物生长

**Literal meaning:** “The ten thousand things grow.”  
**Figurative meaning:** All living things flourish through the vital power of Heaven and Earth; the natural order of life’s growth and renewal.

### Source / Origin

The phrase’s imagery is ancient — it appears throughout the **Confucian, Daoist, and poetic canons**:

1. **《詩經·小雅·四月》**
    
    > 「四月維夏，六月徂暑。萬物方盛，天道乃定。」  
    > _“In the fourth month comes summer, in the sixth the heat; all things flourish, Heaven’s order is settled.”_
    
2. **《孟子·滕文公上》**
    
    > 「萬物並育而不相害，道並行而不相悖。」  
    > _“All things grow together without harming one another; their ways move in harmony without conflict.”_
    
3. **《易經·繫辭傳》**
    
    > 「天地絪縕，萬物化醇。」  
    > _“Heaven and Earth interweave, and the myriad things take form.”_
    

The expression **萬物生長** thus encapsulates the _creative harmony between Heaven and Earth (天地)_ — a foundational theme in Chinese cosmology.

### Cultural and Philosophical Meaning

- **Confucian:** Expresses the benevolence of Heaven’s order — _Heaven nourishes all things impartially_ (**天道無親**).
    
- **Daoist:** Reflects the spontaneous self-generation of the Dao — _Dao gives birth to one, one to two, two to three, three to the ten thousand things_ (**道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物**).
    
- **Buddhist (later usage):** The universal interdependence and transformation of life.
    
- **Modern:** The growth and renewal of nature, society, or human potential.

### Cross-Cultural Parallels

- **Hebrew Bible:** _Genesis 1:11–12_ — “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit.”
    
- **Christian Chinese usage:** Missionaries often cited **萬物生長** as a natural expression of _divine creation and providence_ — God causing all things to grow.
    
- **Korean & Japanese Neo-Confucians** also adopted it as shorthand for _natural moral order_ — the principle that life itself is proof of cosmic harmony.

### Sentiment

> **“All things grow and flourish — Heaven and Earth breathe life into the world.”**

A serene, life-affirming phrase expressing the cosmic pulse of renewal.  
Where _鏡花水月_ and _空中樓閣_ spoke of illusion, _萬物生長_ turns to **reality and vitality** — the eternal spring of creation.
