### Source / Origin

Originates from **《史記·孟嘗君列傳》 (Records of the Grand Historian – Biography of Lord Mengchang)** by **Sima Qian (司馬遷)**.

Story summary:  
During the Warring States period, **Lord Mengchang (孟嘗君)** of Qi had a large retinue of retainers, many of them with strange or dubious talents.  
When he fell out of favor in the State of Qin and was imprisoned, he escaped thanks to two of these men:

- One who could **imitate a rooster’s crow**, fooling the guards into opening the gates early.
    
- Another who could **steal a dog** (or bribe a guard with a stolen pelt), obtaining the token needed for passage.
    

Thus, “rooster-crower and dog-thief” came to symbolize **those with base but useful skills**, or more broadly, _lowly people who nonetheless achieve great results through cunning._

### Cultural Notes

- **Chinese:** Usually negative — referring to deceitful or insignificant men. But sometimes used admiringly for resourceful trickery that saves the day.
    
- **Japanese:** _鶏鳴狗盗 (keimei kutō)_ often appears in essays as a moral warning against being “petty in ability but proud in manner.”
    
- **Korean:** _계명구도_ is a well-known _사자성어_ (four-character idiom) meaning “petty skill,” sometimes used self-deprecatingly.
    
- **Vietnamese:** _Kê minh cẩu đạo_ similarly refers to crafty but small-minded people — “tricksters, not gentlemen.”

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
這些人不過是鷄鳴狗盜之徒，難成大事。  
_These people are mere tricksters — the sort who crow like roosters and steal like dogs; they cannot accomplish great things._

**Korean:**  
그는 계명구도의 재주밖에 없다.  
_He has only the petty talents of a rooster-crower and dog-thief._

**Japanese:**  
彼は鶏鳴狗盗の徒にすぎない。  
_He’s nothing more than a petty trickster._

### Sentiment

> **“Petty cunning and lowly trickery — contemptible in moral worth, yet sometimes surprisingly useful.”**

Originally mocking the base retainers of a nobleman, the phrase has evolved into a proverb about _small talents, cunning minds,_ and _unexpected utility_.
