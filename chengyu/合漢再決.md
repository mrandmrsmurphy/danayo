# 合漢再決

## Literal meaning
“Unite the Han (scriptural world) and decide anew.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
A call for the renewed unity of the CJKV cultural sphere through a shared classical and scriptural inheritance, consciously re-chosen rather than inherited by inertia. The idiom frames unity not as political consolidation or external alignment, but as a deliberate recommitment to the common textual, philosophical, and linguistic ground that historically linked Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese literati.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** hé hàn zài jué
- **Cantonese:** hap6 hon3 zoi3 kyut3
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** ごうかんさいけつ
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 합한재결 (hap han jae-gyeol)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** hợp hán tái quyết

## Notes on scope and tone
合漢再決 is civilizational rather than nationalist in scope. 漢 refers to the shared classical written tradition rather than to ethnicity or modern state identity. 再決 emphasizes intentional renewal: a conscious choice made after historical rupture, modernization, and divergence. The tone is formal and programmatic
