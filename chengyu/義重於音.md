# 義重於音

**Literal sense:** “Meaning outweighs sound.”  
**Implied principle:** In cases of tension, semantic force has priority over phonetic resemblance.

This sits naturally alongside [[信達雅化]], but it sharpens the hierarchy. Where Yan Fu balances axes, **義重於音** establishes priority. It tells you what to sacrifice first.

## Conceptual Scope
The phrase applies especially in contexts where translators are tempted by:
- phonetic mimicry
- rhetorical symmetry
- alliteration or metrical echo
- preservation of proper names purely by sound

It asserts that semantic integrity governs such choices.

This is not anti-form. It is anti-form-when-form-distorts-sense.

## Philosophical Lineage
There is a long tension in translation history between:
- sound-based transfer
- sense-based transfer

In Western theory, this parallels debates between “word-for-word” and “sense-for-sense” approaches. In East Asian contexts, Buddhist translators often struggled with whether to transliterate Sanskrit or translate meaning.

**義重於音** clearly sides with interpretive clarity.

It also implies a view of language:
- Words are vehicles.
- Meaning is the cargo.
- If the vessel must change to preserve the cargo, so be it.

## Practical Consequences
1. When a pun cannot survive transfer, preserve the argument, annotate the pun.
2. When meter obscures logic, privilege logical clarity.
3. When phonetic imitation misleads readers about conceptual categories, abandon it.
4. In theological or philosophical translation, conceptual accuracy governs stylistic charm.

## Relationship to 信達雅化
- **信** aligns naturally with 義重於音.
- **達** supports it, since clarity usually requires privileging sense.
- **雅** is the one most constrained by it, since elegance often leans on sound.

So if 信達雅化 is your discipline,  
義重於音 is your internal ranking principle.

It tells you how to decide when the virtues conflict.
