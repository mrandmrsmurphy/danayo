### Source / Origin
The idiom comes from the **ancient marriage custom** of the Zhou and Han dynasties, when a bride and groom would **tie a lock of their hair together** during the wedding ceremony — symbolizing unity of body and destiny.

Earliest references trace to:
- 《後漢書·竇融傳》: 「結髮之妻，恩終不改。」  
    _“The wife with whom I bound hair — my affection for her never changed.”_    
- This reflected the Confucian virtue of **faithfulness and constancy in marriage**, particularly the moral ideal that a husband should never abandon the wife of his youth (cf. _Malachi 2:14_ in Christian parallel).    

Over time, **結髮夫妻** became a literary phrase for a _married couple who have shared life since youth_, often through hardship or success, implying deep mutual loyalty and gratitude.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Evokes conjugal fidelity and lifelong partnership; sometimes used in epitaphs or elegiac writing (“結髮夫妻，白首同穴” — _“A couple bound in hair, buried together in old age.”_)    
- **Japanese:** Less common as an idiom but appears in classical literature and Noh/Kabuki scripts symbolizing old marital vows.    
- **Korean:** Used in historical and moral literature emphasizing _정절 (jeongjeol, chastity and loyalty)_ between spouses.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Kết phát phu thê_ appears in poetry and Confucian moral texts as an ideal of lifelong devotion.
