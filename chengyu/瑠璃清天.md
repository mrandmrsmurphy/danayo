### Source:

Exodus 24:10

> "And they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness." (Ex 24:10, ESV)

### Examples:

- 摩西等見神,其足下有瑠璃清天之景。(Moses and the others saw God, and under his feet was the vision of lapis clear as heaven.)
- 神之栄光如瑠璃清天,超越人之所能想。(God's glory is like lapis clear as heaven, surpassing what humans can imagine.)

### Cultural Notes:

瑠璃 (lapis lazuli/sapphire) evokes the brilliant blue stone, while 清天 (clear-heaven) captures the extraordinary clarity "like the very heaven" in the original text. This theophany on Mount Sinai, where the elders of Israel saw God and survived, presents a rare and mysterious vision of divine majesty. The sapphire pavement beneath God's feet suggests both transcendent beauty and the firmament of heaven itself. The phrase can metaphorically describe divine glory, heavenly beauty, or moments of transcendent encounter with the sacred.

### Sentiment:

Mystical, awe-inspiring, transcendent. Used to describe divine glory, heavenly beauty, sacred visions, or the overwhelming majesty of God's presence.
