## Origins

### 1. **Sen no Rikyū (千利休, 1522–1591)**

- The phrase is strongly associated with the Japanese **tea ceremony (茶道)**.    
- Sen no Rikyū taught that each tea gathering should be treated with utmost sincerity because it can never be repeated in exactly the same way.    
- He did not necessarily use the exact four-character phrase, but the idea is rooted in his teaching of _ichiza ichie_ (一座一会, “one sitting, one meeting”).    

### 2. **Yamanoue Sōji (山上宗二, d. 1590)**

- A disciple of Rikyū, he recorded in **《山上宗二記》** (Yamanoue Sōji ki) the ethos that each tea gathering is a once-in-a-lifetime event.    
- This is one of the earliest textual witnesses of the idea.    

### 3. **Ii Naosuke (井伊直弼, 1815–1860)**

- The daimyo and tea master who later codified the phrase in his treatise **《茶湯一会集》** (_Cha-no-yu Ichie-shū_, “Tea Gathering Anthology”), mid-19th century.    
- He popularized the fixed form **一期一会** as we know it.
