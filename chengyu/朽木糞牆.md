**Literal meaning:** “Rotten wood, dung-plastered wall.”  
**Extended sense:** A person beyond improvement; material so corrupt that instruction or reform is pointless.

### Source
From **《論語·公冶長》** (Book 5). The judgment is attributed to **孔子**, delivered as a sharp evaluative remark rather than a general maxim.

### Classical background
朽木 cannot be carved; 糞牆 cannot be plastered smooth. The pairing joins two images of structural worthlessness. The force of the phrase lies in its finality. This is not criticism meant to correct behavior, but an assessment that correction itself is futile.

In the _Analects_, such language is rare and therefore striking. Confucius is typically patient with moral formation. When he resorts to categorical dismissal, it signals a boundary of pedagogical responsibility. Some characters, by temperament or habit, resist formation altogether.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 朽木糞牆 is used sparingly and harshly. It appears in literary writing, historical commentary, or emphatic condemnation. In everyday speech it is strong and often avoided, as it denies not just virtue but potential. When used, it conveys resignation rather than anger.

### Pronunciations across CJKV
- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _xiǔ mù fèn qiáng_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _nau2 muk6 fan3 coeng4_
- **Japanese (on-yomi, hiragana):**  
    **きゅうぼくふんしょう**
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _hu-mok bun-jang_ (후목분장)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _hủ mộc phẩn tường_

### Usage note
Unlike idioms that rebuke conduct while preserving hope of reform, 朽木糞牆 withdraws hope entirely. Its severity comes from that withdrawal.
