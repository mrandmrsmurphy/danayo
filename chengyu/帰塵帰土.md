### Source:

Genesis 3:19, Ecclesiastes 3:20

> "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." (Gen 3:19, ESV) "All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return." (Eccl 3:20, ESV)

### Examples:

- 人生有限,終必帰塵帰土。(Human life is limited; ultimately we must return to dust, return to earth.)
- 無論貧富貴賤,皆帰塵帰土,平等於死。(Regardless of poverty, wealth, nobility or baseness, all return to dust, return to earth—equal in death.)

### Cultural Notes:

The parallel structure 帰塵/帰土 (return-dust/return-earth) creates rhythmic balance while emphasizing the inevitability of death and bodily decomposition. This phrase captures both God's curse after the Fall and the broader Biblical recognition of human mortality and creatureliness. 帰 (return) emphasizes that death is a return to our origin—we came from dust and return to it. Often used in funeral liturgy across Christian traditions, it serves as a memento mori, reminding humans of their finitude and dependence on God.

### Sentiment:

Solemn, mortality-focused, humbling. Used in contexts of death, funerals, or to emphasize human frailty and the equality of all before death.
