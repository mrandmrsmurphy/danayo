- 造反贖完 (made-rebellion-atonement-completion, alternate vocabulary)
- 創世反逆救贖完成 (creation-world rebellion redemption completion, fuller form)

### Source:

The metanarrative of Scripture: Genesis 1-2 (Creation), Genesis 3 (Fall), Gospel accounts and Epistles (Redemption), Revelation 21-22 (Consummation)

> "In the beginning, God created..." (Gen 1:1); "Therefore...sin came into the world" (Rom 5:12); "God so loved the world that he gave his only Son" (John 3:16); "Behold, I am making all things new" (Rev 21:5, ESV)

### Examples:

- 聖書之大義可以創反救成四字概之。(The great meaning of Scripture can be summarized in the four characters: creation, fall, redemption, consummation.)
- 神之計画由創反救成,終必成全。(God's plan proceeds through creation, fall, redemption, and consummation, and will certainly be fulfilled.)

### Cultural Notes:

創反救成 brilliantly compresses the four-act structure of Biblical theology. 創 (creation) - God's good work establishing humanity in fellowship; 反 (rebellion/reversal) - the Fall introducing sin and death; 救 (salvation/rescue) - Christ's redemptive work on the cross; 成 (completion/consummation) - the new creation and restoration of all things. This framework provides interpretive coherence to the entire Biblical narrative, showing history moving purposefully from paradise lost through redemption toward paradise restored. Each character represents not just an event but an entire theological category essential to Christian understanding.

### Sentiment:

Theological, comprehensive, hopeful. Used to summarize the Biblical worldview, express confidence in God's sovereign plan, or provide framework for understanding salvation history.
