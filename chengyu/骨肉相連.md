    - **骨肉之恩** – “the natural affection of kin.”

### Source / Origin
Not traceable to a single classical line, but **rooted in ancient Chinese kinship metaphors** found in texts like:
- 《左傳》 (“Zuo Zhuan”) — uses “骨肉” metaphorically for kin: “骨肉之親，不可棄也” (_‘The ties of bone and flesh cannot be cast away.’_)    
- 《禮記·祭義》 — speaks of the family bond as “合體同氣” (_‘one body, one breath’_).    

The pairing of **骨 (bone)** and **肉 (flesh)** to express blood relations became standard by the Han dynasty.  
Thus, _骨肉相連_ is a natural synthesis meaning “kin are connected as bone and flesh.”

---
### Cultural & Comparative Notes
- **Confucian context:** Stresses _filial piety (孝)_ and the sacredness of family unity; separation or betrayal of kin is seen as against nature.    
- **Biblical parallel:** _Genesis 2:23_, “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” uses nearly the same imagery — which makes _骨肉相連_ feel “biblical” when used in Chinese Christian writing. Mission-era translations and sermons often borrowed or echoed this phrase for that reason.   
- **Korean & Vietnamese usage:** Similar sense — the unbreakable tie of family affection.    
- **Japanese:** Not common as a set phrase, but the concept appears as **骨肉の情** (“ties of flesh and blood”).

### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
兄弟雖遠，骨肉相連。  
_Though brothers are far apart, flesh and bone remain connected._

**Korean:**  
비록 멀리 떨어져 있어도 골육상련이다.  
_Even though they live far apart, they are bound by blood and flesh._

**Vietnamese:**  
Dù cách xa, cốt nhục tương liên.  
_Though separated by distance, blood and bone remain joined._

### Sentiment
> **“Family bonds are natural and inseparable — kin are joined as bone and flesh.”**
A universal proverb expressing _affection, loyalty,_ and _the pain of separation_ — deeply Chinese in origin, yet resonant with Biblical imagery.
