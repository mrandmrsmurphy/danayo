### Source:

Daniel 5:25-28

> "And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN. This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; TEKEL, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians." (Dan 5:25-28, ESV)

### Examples:

- 驕王見数数衡分之文,知其国運已尽。(The proud king saw the "numbered, numbered, weighed, divided" writing and knew his kingdom's fate was finished.)
- 不義之国必受数数衡分之判。(An unrighteous nation will surely receive the judgment of "numbered, weighed, divided.")

### Cultural Notes:

This brilliantly compressed rendering captures the famous writing on the wall at Belshazzar's feast. 数数 (numbered-numbered) reflects the doubled MENE, emphasizing divine calculation and finality. 衡 (weighed) preserves TEKEL's judgment imagery—the scales of divine justice. 分 (divided) renders PARSIN/PERES, prophesying the kingdom's partition. The four characters elegantly parallel the four Aramaic words while conveying their interpreted meaning: God has counted your days, weighed your worth, and decreed your kingdom's division. This serves as a potent metaphor for divine judgment against pride and sacrilege.

### Sentiment:

Ominous, prophetic, judgmental. Used to pronounce divine verdict, warn of impending doom, or describe the inevitable downfall of the arrogant and wicked.
