### Source / Origin

The phrase originates in **Daoist and Buddhist writings**, with early references in **《神仙傳》 (Biographies of Immortals)** and **《搜神後記》 (Sequel to In Search of the Supernatural)** from the **Eastern Jin (4th century CE)**:

> 「麻姑謂王方平曰：‘自吾得道以來，已見東海三為桑田。’」  
> _The immortal Magu said to Wang Fangping: “Since I attained the Way, I have seen the Eastern Sea turn into mulberry fields three times.”_

In Chinese mythology, the **immortal Magu (麻姑)**, with her long life, had witnessed the coastline shift over eons — a poetic way to express how even vast seas can dry up and farmland can flood again.

Thus, **滄海桑田** became a metaphor for **the impermanence of worldly affairs**, a cosmic scale of change where even the most enduring things transform.

### Cultural and Philosophical Meaning

- **Daoist:** Reflects the natural cycles of transformation — everything changes according to the Dao’s ceaseless flow.
    
- **Buddhist:** Illustrates _anicca_ (impermanence); the illusory stability of worldly forms.
    
- **Confucian:** A moral warning — do not trust in wealth or power, for fortune shifts like the sea.
    
- **Literary:** A sigh of nostalgia for vanished worlds, dynasties, and loves.

### Historical Usage

By the Tang and Song periods, _滄海桑田_ appeared frequently in poems about **time, loss, and memory**.  
For example, **白居易 (Bai Juyi)** and **蘇軾 (Su Shi)** both used it to express the transformation of landscapes and human fortunes.

Modern writers extend it to describe **technological or social change**:

> 百年之間，滄海桑田。  
> _In a hundred years, the blue seas have turned to mulberry fields._

### Sentiment

> **“Even seas become fields; nothing endures unchanged.”**

It expresses awe and melancholy before time’s vast transformations —  
a worldview at once **Daoist in detachment**, **Buddhist in compassion**, and **Confucian in sober reflection.**
