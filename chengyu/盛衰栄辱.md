### Source / Origin

The dualism of _盛衰_ and _榮辱_ is ancient:

- **《易經·繫辭傳》** speaks of **盛衰有時** — “prosperity and decline each have their time.”
    
- **《史記·太史公自序》** observes the _興衰成敗_ of dynasties — “the rise and fall, success and failure of states.”
    
- **Confucius (《論語·憲問》):** _“不以物喜，不以己悲”_ — “not exulting in gain, nor grieving in loss” — the attitude of equanimity toward _榮辱盛衰._
    

By the Han–Tang period, the four-character compound **盛衰榮辱** (or its variants) was well established as a moral reflection on the impermanence of worldly fortune.

### Philosophical Meaning

- **Confucian:** Teaches moderation and detachment — the gentleman (_君子_) maintains virtue through all circumstances.
    
- **Daoist:** Everything follows natural cycles — when things reach fullness (_盛_), they turn to decline (_衰_).  
    → cf. **物極必反** — “When things reach their extreme, they reverse.”
    
- **Buddhist:** Reflects _anicca_ (impermanence) — glory and disgrace, rise and fall, all are transient.

### Cultural Notes

In East Asia this phrase became a key theme for **historiography and personal ethics**:

- Chinese historians used it to describe dynastic cycles.
    
- Japanese samurai and Zen monks used it to express _mujo (無常)_ — the transience of fame and success.
    
- Korean and Vietnamese scholars quoted it as a reminder of humility and detachment.
