### Source / Origin

The phrase originates in **《老子·道德經》** (_Dao De Jing_), chapters 2, 3, and 57, where **Laozi (老子)** sets forth the idea that true governance flows from _non-interference_:

> **「我無為而民自化；我好靜而民自正；我無事而民自富；我無欲而民自樸。」**  
> _“I act through non-action, and the people transform themselves;  
> I cherish stillness, and the people become upright;  
> I refrain from meddling, and the people prosper;  
> I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.”_

Later thinkers — especially **Zhuangzi (莊子)** and **Huainanzi (淮南子)** — expanded this into a broader _cosmic and political principle_:  
when rulers emulate the Dao’s natural spontaneity (**自然**), harmony arises spontaneously, without coercion.

### Philosophical Meaning

1. **Daoist cosmology:**
    
    - _無為 (non-action)_ does **not** mean literal inaction.
        
    - It means acting **without contrivance (無人為)** — letting things follow their own nature (**順其自然**).
        
2. **Political philosophy:**
    
    - The ideal ruler governs lightly, interfering as little as possible.
        
    - Laws and punishments should be minimal; moral example and harmony suffice.
        
3. **Moral application:**
    
    - The sage cultivates virtue not by striving, but by being attuned to the Dao.

### Historical and Cultural Notes

- **Han dynasty emperors** such as **Emperor Wen (漢文帝)** praised and practiced _無為而治_, ushering in a peaceful era known as the _Rule of Wen and Jing (文景之治)_.
    
- **Confucianism** later integrated this ideal — _govern by virtue (德治)_ rather than punishment — softening Legalist rigor.
    
- **Modern usage:** Refers to _hands-off management_ — a style of leadership that trusts subordinates and allows systems to self-regulate.
