# 論功行賞 / 论功行赏

**Literal meaning:** “Discuss merits and confer rewards.”  
**Figurative meaning:** To evaluate achievements and distribute rewards accordingly; to reward merit justly.

### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** lùn gōng xíng shǎng (4–1–2–3)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** leon6 gung1 hang4 soeng2    
- **Korean:** 논공행상 (論功行賞)     
- **Japanese:** ろんこうこうしょう（論功行賞）_ronkō kōshō_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** luận công hành thưởng    

### Variants
- **Traditional:** 論功行賞    
- **Simplified:** 论功行赏    
- Synonymous forms:    
    - **論功封賞** – “to discuss merit and bestow rewards.”        
    - **功過相抵** – “to weigh merit and fault.”        

### Source / Origin
The expression comes from the **Han dynasty** bureaucratic ideal and appears in historical works such as **《後漢書·光武帝紀》** and **《晉書》**.

A classic formulation is:
> 「論功行賞，各有差等。」  
> _“When merits are discussed and rewards are given, each receives his proper rank.”_

Here, _論功_ means to **assess contributions** (literally “discuss merit”), and _行賞_ means to **carry out rewards**. Together, they express a political ethic of **meritocracy and justice** — rewarding accomplishment rather than birth or favoritism.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** A standard idiom in historical and official contexts — the fair distribution of honors, offices, or material rewards after success in war, politics, or collective enterprise.    
    - Example: “戰後，朝廷論功行賞，將士各得其所。”  
        _After the war, the court evaluated merit and gave each soldier his due._        
- **Japanese:** _論功行賞 (ronkō kōshō)_ retains exactly this bureaucratic sense and is still used in politics, business, and military history to mean “rewarding merit.”    
- **Korean:** _논공행상_ is a familiar _사자성어_, used both literally (distributing rewards) and figuratively (recognizing contribution).    
- **Vietnamese:** _Luận công hành thưởng_ appears in Confucian royal proclamations and moral treatises about just governance.    

### Philosophical and Moral Context
- **Confucian:** Reflects fairness and gratitude — those who serve the state should be duly recognized, maintaining moral order.    
- **Legalist:** Expresses the pragmatic principle that rewards and punishments should follow measurable results (_賞罰分明_).    
- **Biblical parallel (in tone):** “The laborer is worthy of his wages” (Luke 10:7) — not identical in scope, but similar in justice-based ethics.    

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
戰後，朝廷論功行賞，賜爵有差。  
_After the battle, the court discussed merits and awarded titles accordingly._

**Japanese:**  
戦功を挙げた者には論功行賞が行われた。  
_Those who achieved military merit were duly rewarded._

**Korean:**  
전쟁이 끝난 뒤 왕은 논공행상을 실시했다.  
_After the war, the king carried out merit-based rewards._

**Vietnamese:**  
Sau chiến thắng, triều đình luận công hành thưởng, ban tước cho công thần.  
_After the victory, the court evaluated merits and rewarded the meritorious officials._

### Sentiment
> **“To recognize and reward true merit — each according to his deeds.”**

It stands for _justice, gratitude,_ and _order_ — a core Confucian principle of governance, where reward follows virtue and achievement, not favor or lineage.
