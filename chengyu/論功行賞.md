### Source / Origin
The expression comes from the **Han dynasty** bureaucratic ideal and appears in historical works such as **《後漢書·光武帝紀》** and **《晉書》**.

A classic formulation is:
> 「論功行賞，各有差等。」  
> _“When merits are discussed and rewards are given, each receives his proper rank.”_

Here, _論功_ means to **assess contributions** (literally “discuss merit”), and _行賞_ means to **carry out rewards**. Together, they express a political ethic of **meritocracy and justice** — rewarding accomplishment rather than birth or favoritism.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** A standard idiom in historical and official contexts — the fair distribution of honors, offices, or material rewards after success in war, politics, or collective enterprise.    
    - Example: “戰後，朝廷論功行賞，將士各得其所。”  
        _After the war, the court evaluated merit and gave each soldier his due._        
- **Japanese:** _論功行賞 (ronkō kōshō)_ retains exactly this bureaucratic sense and is still used in politics, business, and military history to mean “rewarding merit.”    
- **Korean:** _논공행상_ is a familiar _사자성어_, used both literally (distributing rewards) and figuratively (recognizing contribution).    
- **Vietnamese:** _Luận công hành thưởng_ appears in Confucian royal proclamations and moral treatises about just governance.    

---
### Philosophical and Moral Context
- **Confucian:** Reflects fairness and gratitude — those who serve the state should be duly recognized, maintaining moral order.    
- **Legalist:** Expresses the pragmatic principle that rewards and punishments should follow measurable results (_賞罰分明_).    
- **Biblical parallel (in tone):** “The laborer is worthy of his wages” (Luke 10:7) — not identical in scope, but similar in justice-based ethics.

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
戰後，朝廷論功行賞，賜爵有差。  
_After the battle, the court discussed merits and awarded titles accordingly._

**Japanese:**  
戦功を挙げた者には論功行賞が行われた。  
_Those who achieved military merit were duly rewarded._

**Korean:**  
전쟁이 끝난 뒤 왕은 논공행상을 실시했다.  
_After the war, the king carried out merit-based rewards._

**Vietnamese:**

### Sentiment
> **“To recognize and reward true merit — each according to his deeds.”**

It stands for _justice, gratitude,_ and _order_ — a core Confucian principle of governance, where reward follows virtue and achievement, not favor or lineage.
