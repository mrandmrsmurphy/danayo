# 毎字明意

## Literal meaning
“Each character has a clear meaning.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle of semantic determinacy: every character in Dan’a’yo is assigned a single core meaning. Additional senses may arise through transparent metaphorical extension, but true semantic branching is kept distinct from figurative usage. This separation allows productive and intelligible word formation while avoiding uncontrolled polysemy.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** měi zì míng yì
- **Cantonese:** mui5 zi6 ming4 ji3
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** まいじめいい
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 매자명의 (mae-ja myeong-ui)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** mỗi tự minh nghĩa

## Notes on scope and tone
毎字明意 is semantic and methodological in scope. 明 emphasizes clarity and inspectability rather than reductionism. The idiom affirms continuity with the regional tradition of semantic derivation, where metaphor generates new expressions without erasing the underlying conceptual core.
