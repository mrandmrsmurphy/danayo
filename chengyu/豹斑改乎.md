### Source:

Jeremiah 13:23

> "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil." (Jer 13:23, ESV)

### Examples:

- 悪人之性如豹斑改乎,難以自変。(The nature of the wicked is like [asking] can a leopard change its spots—difficult to change by oneself.)
- 習久成性,豹斑改乎?(When habit becomes nature, can a leopard change its spots?)

### Cultural Notes:

The rhetorical 乎 particle preserves the question form from the original Hebrew rhetorical question, emphasizing impossibility. This phrase expresses the Biblical teaching that human nature, especially when habituated to evil, cannot be reformed through mere human effort—divine intervention is necessary. The leopard metaphor resonates across cultures as a symbol of unchangeable nature.

### Sentiment:

Rhetorical, pessimistic regarding human self-reform. Used to express the impossibility of changing deeply ingrained character or habits without external (divine) help.
