- **Related idioms:**
    - 安家立業 (_to settle down and make a living_)
    - 成家之道 (_the way of establishing a household_)
    - 功成名就 (_to achieve success and fame_)
    - 事業有成 (_to accomplish a career_)
- **Poetic variant:** 成室立功 (_to form a household and attain merit_), found in Han-era texts.

### Source / Origin
The idiom _成家立業_ combines two ancient moral milestones in the Confucian order of life: **marriage (成家)** and **occupation (立業)**.

The first half, _成家_, “to form a family,” appears in the _Book of Rites_ (《禮記·昏義》):

> 昏禮者，將合二姓之好，上以事宗廟，而下以繼後世也。  
> _The marriage rite unites two families in harmony — above, to serve the ancestors; below, to continue the generations._

The second half, _立業_, “to establish one’s enterprise,” appears throughout early texts, such as _Mencius_ (《孟子·離婁下》):

> 有恆產者有恆心。  
> _Only those who have a stable livelihood can maintain a stable heart._

Together, the phrase _成家立業_ took form in the Han and later dynasties as a succinct moral goal: **to complete one’s social and personal duty** — to build a family, sustain it through one’s work, and thereby contribute to the moral fabric of society.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning
_成家立業_ embodies the **Confucian ideal of adulthood and responsibility.**

To _成家_ is not merely to marry, but to **enter the moral order** — to become a husband or wife, a son or daughter-in-law, and eventually a parent who continues the ancestral line (_孝_, filial piety).  
To _立業_ is not simply to find employment, but to **establish a life of purpose and virtue** — a livelihood that supports others and expresses one’s character (_德_).

In Confucian cosmology, the harmony of the state depends on the harmony of the family:

> 修身齊家治國平天下。  
> _Cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state, bring peace to the world._  
> (_Great Learning_, 《大學》)

Thus, _成家立業_ represents **the middle stage of life’s Confucian arc** — between self-cultivation and public service — the responsible fulfillment of one’s earthly and familial duties.

In **Daoist** reflection, however, to _成家立業_ may also mark the tension between simplicity and attachment — a worldly accomplishment that can distract from the freedom of the Dao. In that sense, it stands as the necessary but temporary “nest” of human life.
### Usage Across Cultures
**Modern Chinese:**  
Commonly used to describe the mature stage of life when one has both family and career.

> 他已經成家立業，是個可靠的人。  
> _He’s already married and established his career — a dependable man._

**Japanese:**  
せいかりつぎょう (_seika ritsugyō_) is a formal expression, often appearing in biographies or moral writing, paralleling the Confucian notion of _修身斉家_.

> 若くして成家立業し、家名を興した。  
> _At a young age he built his household and established his enterprise, reviving his family’s name._

**Korean:**  
성가립업 (_seongga rip-eop_) appears in classical-style essays and Confucian family teachings, reflecting the expected life path of a mature adult.

> 남자는 성가립업하여 부모를 기쁘게 해야 한다.  
> _A man should marry and make his career to bring joy to his parents._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Thành gia lập nghiệp_ is still widely used and valued as a traditional life goal.

> Anh ấy đã thành gia lập nghiệp, cuộc sống ổn định và hạnh phúc.  
> _He has married and established his career — a stable, happy life._

### Example Usage
1. **Chinese:**  
    成家立業，是人生責任的起點。  
    _To build a family and career is the starting point of life’s responsibilities._
2. **Japanese:**  
    成家立業して初めて、一人前の社会人となる。  
    _Only after forming a household and livelihood does one become a full member of society._

### Sentiment
> “To root one’s life in love and labor — the true measure of maturity.”
