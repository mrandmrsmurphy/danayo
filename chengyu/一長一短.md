# 一長一短
## Literal meaning
“One long, one short.”  
### Extended sense
Mixed strengths and weaknesses; gains accompanied by losses; an uneven or balanced contrast rather than pure advantage.
## Source
Traditionally traced to **《史記》**, 卷八七, **李斯列傳**. In that context, the phrase is part of an evaluative register used to weigh policies, persons, or outcomes, emphasizing that real situations rarely admit unqualified judgments.

### Classical background
The construction is archetypal Classical Chinese parallelism. The pairing of opposites compresses an argument into four characters, inviting comparison rather than conclusion. Unlike moralizing maxims, 一長一短 functions analytically. It names the condition of mixed assessment and leaves the judgment to context. This made it especially useful in historiography and political reasoning, where balance and tradeoffs mattered.

## Modern usage
Across the region, the idiom is used to acknowledge pros and cons without dramatization. It appears in essays, editorials, classroom discussion, and everyday speech when someone wants to concede complexity or avoid absolutism. The tone is neutral and reflective rather than admonitory.

## Pronunciations across CJKV

- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _yì cháng yì duǎn_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _jat1 coeng4 jat1 dyun2_
- **Japanese (On-yomi):**  
    _itchō ittan_  
    (Common in written and formal contexts.)
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _il-jang il-dan_ (일장일단)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _nhất trường nhất đoản_

## Usage note
Compared with evaluative idioms that push toward a verdict, 一長一短 is deliberately incomplete. Its rhetorical force lies in restraint. It signals that a situation deserves weighing, not slogans.
