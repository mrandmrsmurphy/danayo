# 文言現代

## Literal meaning
“Classical language, contemporary use.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle that classical written forms and modern communicative needs are not opposites but complementary layers of a single linguistic continuum. 文言現代 affirms that a language may retain the concision, abstraction, and cultural density of classical style while functioning as a practical medium for present-day communication. In <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> discourse, it names an approach that modernizes usage without vernacularizing structure.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** wén yán xiàn dài
- **Cantonese:** man4 jin4 jin6 doi6
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** ぶんげんげんだい
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 문언현대 (mun-eon hyeon-dae)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** văn ngôn hiện đại

**Notes on scope and tone**  
文言現代 is methodological and synthetic in scope. It rejects the binary between archaic preservation and full vernacular replacement, proposing instead a layered continuity.
