### Source:

Genesis 3:14

> "The LORD God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.'" (Gen 3:14, ESV)

### Examples:

- 蛇受咒腹行食塵,以示其堕落之深。(The serpent received the curse to crawl on its belly and eat dust, to show the depth of its fall.)
- 悪者終必如腹行食塵,極其卑賤。(The wicked will ultimately be like [those who] crawl on their bellies and eat dust, utterly debased.)

### Cultural Notes:

This phrase captures God's curse upon the serpent after the Fall. 腹行 (belly-crawl) emphasizes the humiliating posture of crawling, while 食塵 (eat-dust) symbolizes complete degradation and defeat. In Biblical context, eating dust represents total subjugation (cf. Micah 7:17, Psalm 72:9). The four-character form preserves both elements of the curse—the mode of locomotion and the perpetual humiliation—making it usable as a metaphor for disgrace or divine judgment.

### Sentiment:

Condemnatory, humiliating. Used to describe utter defeat, degradation, divine curse, or the consequences of pride and rebellion.
