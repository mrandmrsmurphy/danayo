### Source / Origin
The idiom crystallized during the **late imperial period**, though its components are much older:

- **[[生機]] (shēngjī)** — literally “life-movement” or “vital mechanism.” In classical Chinese (e.g. _《莊子》_, _《淮南子》_), it referred to **the generative force of nature** — that which causes things to live and grow.
    
- **[[勃勃]] (bóbó)** — an onomatopoetic reduplicative adjective meaning **surging, vigorous, thriving** (as in _勃然興起_ “to rise with force”).    

By the Ming and Qing periods, writers began pairing them:
> _“春意融融，生機勃勃。”_  
> “Spring’s warmth pervades; life bursts forth abundantly.”

The expression thus entered common usage for scenes of **springtime renewal, prosperity, or youth**.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Very positive, describing landscapes, economies, youth, or even ideas as being full of vitality and promise.    
- **Korean:** _생기발발_ retains the same meaning — vigorous life, energy, or morale.    
- **Vietnamese:** _sinh cơ bột bột_ describes flourishing development, especially in literature or ecology.    
- **Japanese:** Not common as a set yojijukugo, but recognized in academic or poetic registers.   

Because of its natural imagery, it’s often found in **modern Christian Chinese writing** to describe _creation, resurrection, or spiritual renewal_, hence the “biblical resonance” .

### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
春天的田野生機勃勃，一片翠綠。  
_In spring the fields are full of life, a sea of green._
**Korean:**  
그 도시는 생기발발하다.  
_The city is full of vibrant life._
**Vietnamese:**  
Mùa xuân, vạn vật sinh cơ bột bột.  
_In spring, all things teem with new life._

### Sentiment
> **“Vigorous, flourishing, pulsing with the energy of life.”**

It expresses a joyful vision of the world’s renewal — a concept equally at home in Daoist cosmology, Confucian natural ethics, or biblical creation theology.
