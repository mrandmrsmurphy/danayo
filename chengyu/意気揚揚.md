## Classical Sources
The phrase appears in **Sima Qian’s 《史記·項羽本紀》 (Records of the Grand Historian, “Biography of Xiang Yu”).**

Text:

> 項王軍壁垓下，兵少食盡，漢軍及諸侯軍圍之數重。  
> …  
> 項王乃夜起，飲帳中，與美人同飲。歌曰：  
> 力拔山兮氣蓋世，  
> 時不利兮騅不逝。  
> 騅不逝兮可奈何？  
> 虞兮虞兮奈若何！

Commentators (e.g., Pei Yin 裴駰 in his commentary to _Shiji_) describe his earlier demeanor as **“意氣揚揚”** when victorious, contrasted with his despair at the end.

## Later Usage

- **唐詩**: e.g., Du Fu uses similar expressions:
    
    - _意氣風發_ and _意氣揚揚_ both appear in Tang poetry to describe exuberant scholars or generals.
        
- **成語辭典**: Modern dictionaries gloss it as:
    
    - **得意的樣子；神采飛揚** (“The appearance of being pleased with oneself; high-spirited and triumphant”).

**Literal meaning:** “Spirit raised high and on display.”  
**Extended sense:** High-spirited, swaggering, flushed with confidence or triumph; openly buoyant morale.

**Source:** Appears in **史記·項羽本紀**, in the portrayal of **項羽** by **司馬遷**. The phrase contributes to the vivid characterization typical of the biography, capturing an outwardly elevated spirit at a moment of momentum.

**Classical background:**  
意氣 denotes inner resolve, temper, and morale rather than abstract intention. 揚揚 describes that inner state being lifted and visibly carried. The compound therefore names not mere confidence but confidence on display. In the _Xiang Yu_ narrative, this outward buoyancy is often juxtaposed with impending reversal, giving the term a slightly unstable edge: elevation that invites gravity.

**Modern usage:**  
Across the region, 意氣揚揚 is used to describe people who are visibly confident or triumphant, sometimes with an admiring tone, sometimes with a hint of irony. It is common in narrative prose, reportage, and evaluative description. Context determines whether the confidence is read as justified, premature, or performative.
### Pronunciations across CJKV

- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _yì qì yáng yáng_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _ji3 hei3 joeng4 joeng4_
- **Japanese (On-yomi):**  
    _iki yōyō_  
    (Used in literary and descriptive registers.)
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _ui-gi yang-yang_ (의기양양)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _ý khí dương dương_

**Usage note:**  
The idiom sits close to praise but stops short of endorsing judgment. It reports posture and mood, not outcome. In narrative contexts, it often precedes contrast, reversal, or correction.
