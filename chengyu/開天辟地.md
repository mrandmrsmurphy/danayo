### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** kāi tiān pì dì (1–1–4–4)

### Source / Origin

The phrase comes from **ancient Chinese creation myths**, especially the legend of **盤古 (Pángǔ)**:

> 混沌如雞子，盤古生其中。  
> 天地開闢，陰陽分判。  
> _“In the beginning all was chaos, like an unhatched egg.  
> Pangu was born within it; when Heaven and Earth were opened, Yin and Yang were divided.”_  
> — 《三五歷紀》 (Han dynasty source quoted in _Hou Han Shu_)

So **開天闢地** literally describes _cosmic separation_:

- **開 天** — to open or unfold the heavens;
    
- **闢 地** — to clear or establish the earth.
    

By the Tang and Song periods it was already used figuratively to mean _“since the beginning of time”_ or _“utterly unprecedented.”_

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

- **Daoist cosmology:** the birth of duality (陰陽) from primal chaos (混沌).    
- **Confucian historiography:** the starting point of human civilization or dynastic order.    
- **Modern usage:** any first or revolutionary act — “an event that opens Heaven and Earth.”

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
自開天闢地以來，未有此事。  
_Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, such a thing has never happened._

**Japanese:**  
開天闢地の偉業。  
_An achievement as great as the creation of Heaven and Earth._

**Vietnamese:**  
Từ khi khai thiên tích địa chưa từng có việc ấy.  
_Since the world was first opened, such a thing has never occurred._

### Connection to Biblical Imagery

- **Genesis 1 : 1** — “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”  
    → conceptually identical: _開天闢地_ = “to create Heaven and Earth.”
    
- **Noah’s Flood (Genesis 6-9):** not a first creation but a **re-creation**, a cleansing that returns the world to primordial waters before a new order arises.  
    → In Chinese thought, each renewal of Heaven & Earth can be called a _再開天闢地_ — “opening Heaven and Earth anew.”
    

So if you were translating or contextualizing _Genesis_ in classical Chinese style,

- **創世紀 1:1** could be rendered as **上帝開天闢地** — _“God opened Heaven and cleft the Earth.”_
    
- The Flood story could be described as **再開天闢地** — _“a second opening of Heaven and Earth,”_ the rebirth of the world after chaos.

### Sentiment

> **“From the very opening of Heaven and Earth — the dawn of all things.”**

A phrase of **cosmic beginnings and world-making power**, easily resonant with biblical creation or renewal narratives.
