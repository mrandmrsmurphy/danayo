# 百家共承

**Literal sense:** “The hundred schools jointly inherit.”  
Or more fluidly: “All schools share in the inheritance.”

## Structure
- **百家** — the Hundred Schools, classical shorthand for the intellectual plurality of the Warring States period
- **共** — together, in common
- **承** — to receive, inherit, carry forward

The verb 承 is doing important work. It implies continuity rather than synthesis. Not “blend,” not “merge,” not “erase distinctions,” but “receive and transmit.”

## Philosophical Position
This maxim asserts:
1. Intellectual traditions do not arise ex nihilo.
2. Rival schools still stand within a shared civilizational inheritance.
3. Disagreement does not negate continuity.

It pushes against two extremes:
- Sectarian absolutism
- Cultural amnesia

It says plurality exists within continuity.

## Historical Echo
[[百家]] naturally evokes the Warring States period and the later retrospective phrase 百家爭鳴. But your shift from 爭鳴 to 共承 is significant:
- 爭鳴 emphasizes contention.
- 共承 emphasizes transmission.

It reframes the metaphor from noise to lineage.

## Cultural Philosophy
If applied broadly, 百家共承 suggests:
- Traditions argue within a shared grammar.
- Even revolutions inherit categories from what they reject.
- Intellectual life is less a battlefield than a generational relay.

It does not deny real disagreement. It denies rootlessness.

## Practical Implication
In education or cultural theory, this could justify:
- Teaching rival schools as part of one story
- Recovering suppressed traditions without rejecting modern ones
- Building new syntheses while acknowledging prior debts

It is conservative without being homogenizing.
