This concept was systematized during the Han Dynasty, particularly by Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒, 179-104 BCE), who synthesized earlier Confucian ideas into this framework. While the individual virtues (五常) come from earlier Confucian classics, the formal pairing of 三綱五常 as a unified concept became central to imperial Confucianism and remained influential throughout Chinese history.

The framework emphasizes both hierarchical relationships (三綱) and universal moral virtues (五常) that should govern those relationships.
