# 義以立名

**Literal sense:** “By meaning one establishes names.”  
Or more fully: “Names are established on the basis of meaning.”

## Structure
- **義** — meaning, principle, underlying sense
- **以** — by means of, on the basis of
- **立** — to establish, to set upright, to found
- **名** — name, term, designation

## Philosophical Resonance
This pushes deeper than [[義重於音]].

義重於音 governs translation choice.  
義以立名 governs lexical creation.

It asserts that:
- terminology must arise from conceptual substance
- names are justified by semantic structure
- phonetic borrowing is secondary

This echoes older Chinese concerns about 正名, though your phrase does not repeat that vocabulary. It shifts the grounding of naming from social order to semantic coherence.

It also aligns with:
- technical vocabulary formation
- conlang design
- theological terminology
- philosophical translation

The principle is especially powerful in scientific or doctrinal contexts, where phonetic transliteration can obscure conceptual clarity.

## Practical Implications
1. When coining a new term, derive it from the concept’s defining function.
2. When borrowing foreign terms, prefer semantic calque over pure sound imitation, unless the concept lacks analyzable structure.
3. When a term becomes misleading, rename it according to its operative meaning.

In the broader framework:
- [[義重於音]] tells you how to choose in translation.
- [[義以立名]] tells you how to build vocabulary in the first place.

Together, they form a coherent philosophy:
1. Meaning governs sound.
2. Meaning grounds naming.



If pressed, one might even say the two maxims imply a metaphysics of language:  
language exists to bear intelligible structure, not to preserve acoustic form.
