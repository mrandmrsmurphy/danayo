### Source / Origin
The phrase dates to the **Han and Jin dynasties**, when **金科 (golden statutes)** and **玉律 (jade laws)** referred to the **highest codes of law or morality**, written on precious materials to signify their sanctity.

Early textual roots appear in:

- 《晉書·陸機傳》: “金科玉條，不可犯也。”  
    _“Golden statutes and jade regulations must not be violated.”_    

Here, “gold” and “jade” symbolize **purity, incorruptibility, and eternal value**. Over time, the phrase expanded beyond the legal sphere to moral and philosophical use — _the highest standards by which conduct is measured_.

---
### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Used to praise a principle or maxim as _sacred and unchangeable._  
    Example: “這句話成了我們的金科玉律” — “This saying became our inviolable rule.”    
- **Japanese:** _金科玉律 (kinka gyokuritsu)_ is a set phrase meaning “an unbreakable rule,” often with nuance of rigid dogmatism if overused.    
- **Korean:** _금과옥률_ likewise refers to inviolable doctrine or law.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Kim khoa ngọc luật_ appears in Confucian writing to denote _celestial or moral law._

### Biblical & Theological Resonance
The idiom naturally became the Chinese term for the **“Golden Rule”** (Matthew 7:12):

> 「所以無論何事，你們願意人怎樣待你們，你們也要怎樣待人，因為這就是律法和先知的道理。」  
> _“Therefore, whatever you want others to do to you, do also to them.”_

Mission-era translators and preachers often used **金科玉律** to render or describe this verse — calling it _“the Lord’s Golden Rule”_ (_主所立之金科玉律_).

Thus, in Christian Chinese today, **金科玉律** can mean either:
1. The _moral principle par excellence_ (e.g., love your neighbor as yourself), or    
2. Any _unchanging divine commandment_.

### Sentiment
> **“An inviolable moral law — as precious and pure as gold and jade.”**

A phrase bridging **ancient Chinese reverence for moral order** and **biblical reverence for divine command**.  
It captures the universal ideal of a _law written not just on tablets, but on the human heart._
