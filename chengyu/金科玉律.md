# 金科玉律
**Literal meaning:** “Golden precepts and jade laws.”  
**Figurative meaning:** Supreme and inviolable principles; sacred moral or legal standards that must never be broken.

### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** jīn kē yù lǜ (1–1–4–4)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** gam1 fo1 juk6 leot6    
- **Korean:** 금과옥률 (金科玉律)    
- **Japanese:** きんかぎょくりつ（金科玉律）_kinka gyokuritsu_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** kim khoa ngọc luật    

### Variants
- Traditional and Simplified are identical: 金科玉律    
- Related idioms:    
    - **金科玉條 (金科玉条)** – “golden statutes and jade regulations,” an older and slightly broader form.        
    - **鐵律如山** – “iron law like a mountain,” similar in tone but more rigidly legal.        

### Source / Origin
The phrase dates to the **Han and Jin dynasties**, when **金科 (golden statutes)** and **玉律 (jade laws)** referred to the **highest codes of law or morality**, written on precious materials to signify their sanctity.

Early textual roots appear in:
- 《晉書·陸機傳》: “金科玉條，不可犯也。”  
    _“Golden statutes and jade regulations must not be violated.”_    

Here, “gold” and “jade” symbolize **purity, incorruptibility, and eternal value**. Over time, the phrase expanded beyond the legal sphere to moral and philosophical use — _the highest standards by which conduct is measured_.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Used to praise a principle or maxim as _sacred and unchangeable._  
    Example: “這句話成了我們的金科玉律” — “This saying became our inviolable rule.”    
- **Japanese:** _金科玉律 (kinka gyokuritsu)_ is a set phrase meaning “an unbreakable rule,” often with nuance of rigid dogmatism if overused.    
- **Korean:** _금과옥률_ likewise refers to inviolable doctrine or law.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Kim khoa ngọc luật_ appears in Confucian writing to denote _celestial or moral law._    

### Biblical & Theological Resonance
The idiom naturally became the Chinese term for the **“Golden Rule”** (Matthew 7:12):

> 「所以無論何事，你們願意人怎樣待你們，你們也要怎樣待人，因為這就是律法和先知的道理。」  
> _“Therefore, whatever you want others to do to you, do also to them.”_

Mission-era translators and preachers often used **金科玉律** to render or describe this verse — calling it _“the Lord’s Golden Rule”_ (_主所立之金科玉律_).

Thus, in Christian Chinese today, **金科玉律** can mean either:
1. The _moral principle par excellence_ (e.g., love your neighbor as yourself), or    
2. Any _unchanging divine commandment_.    

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**  
誠實守信，是我們公司的金科玉律。  
_Honesty and trustworthiness are our inviolable rules._

**Japanese:**  
彼の家訓は金科玉律のように守られている。  
_Their family maxims are observed as sacred rules._

**Korean:**  
그 말은 우리에게 금과옥률로 여겨진다.  
_Those words are regarded by us as a golden and jade law._

**Vietnamese:**  
“Yêu người như chính mình” là kim khoa ngọc luật của Đạo Cơ-đốc.  
_“Love your neighbor as yourself” is the Golden Rule of Christianity._

### Sentiment
> **“An inviolable moral law — as precious and pure as gold and jade.”**

A phrase bridging **ancient Chinese reverence for moral order** and **biblical reverence for divine command**.  
It captures the universal ideal of a _law written not just on tablets, but on the human heart._
