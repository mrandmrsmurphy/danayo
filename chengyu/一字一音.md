# 一字一音

## Literal meaning
“One character, one sound.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle of strict phonological determinacy: each character corresponds to a single, fixed pronunciation. In Dan’a’yo, a written form unambiguously determines its spoken form, eliminating the multiplicity of readings found in Chinese and Japanese traditions. The idiom asserts a WYSIWYG relationship between script and sound, prioritizing learnability, predictability, and mechanical clarity over historical layering.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** yī zì yī yīn
- **Cantonese:** jat1 zi6 jat1 jam1
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** いちじいちおん
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 일자일음 (il-ja il-eum)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** nhất tự nhất âm

## Notes on scope and tone
一字一音 is technical and normative in scope. It frames orthography as an interface rather than an archive, deliberately rejecting polyphony as a design cost rather than a cultural asset.
