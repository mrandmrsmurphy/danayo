### Source / Origin

The phrase has ancient poetic roots — **海** (“sea”) and **天** (“heaven”) are classic symbols of **limitlessness and harmony between nature’s elements.**  
Although the four-character compound _海闊天空_ doesn’t appear as-is in the _pre-Qin_ canon, the imagery runs through:

- **《文選·張衡〈思玄賦〉》:**
    
    > “觀海者難為水，遊天者難為雲。” (_He who has seen the sea finds other waters shallow; he who has roamed the heavens finds other clouds poor._)
    
- **Tang–Song poetry** often pairs “海闊” and “天空” in couplets describing open landscapes or mental liberation:
    
    > “海闊憑魚躍，天高任鳥飛。” (_The sea is vast for fish to leap, the sky high for birds to fly._)
    

By the **Song dynasty**, the combination **海闊天空** crystallized into a fixed expression meaning _expansive and free_.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

- **Daoist:** Resonates with _無拘無束_ — freedom from constraint; unity with nature’s vastness.
    
- **Confucian:** Symbol of _magnanimity (寬容, 包容)_ — a person whose moral “horizon” is broad as sea and sky.
    
- **Modern / Literary:** Describes **freedom after hardship**, **mental release**, or **creative inspiration.**
    

In **modern Cantonese culture**, it’s iconic: the Hong Kong rock band _Beyond_’s anthem **《海闊天空》** (1993) uses it to symbolize spiritual freedom and perseverance under oppression — giving it deep emotional resonance across generations.

### Example Usage

**Mandarin:**

**Cantonese:**

_Be broad-minded — like sea and sky — don’t be so petty._

**Japanese:**

### Sentiment

> **“Vast as the sea, open as the sky — unbounded in thought and heart.”**

So, not cosmology in the scientific sense — but _cosmic in feeling_:  
the fusion of **Heaven (天)** and **Sea (海)** as metaphors for the infinite, reflecting the Daoist ideal of oneness with the boundless natural order.
