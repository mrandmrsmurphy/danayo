### Source:

Matthew 22:14

> "For many are called, but few are chosen." (Matt 22:14, ESV)

### Examples:

- 主言多召少選,示得救之路窄而難。(The Lord said many are called but few are chosen, showing that the path of salvation is narrow and difficult.)
- 雖多召少選,信徒当努力進入窄門。(Though many are called but few are chosen, believers should strive to enter the narrow gate.)

### Cultural Notes:

多召少選 captures Jesus's sobering conclusion to the parable of the wedding feast. 召 (summon/call) represents God's universal gospel invitation, while 選 (choose/elect) represents those who respond appropriately and are ultimately saved. The contrast 多/少 (many/few) emphasizes the tragedy that despite wide invitation, few actually enter the kingdom. This phrase touches on the tension between divine sovereignty (election) and human responsibility (response to the call). It serves as both warning against presumption and encouragement to earnest faith—the call is genuine, but requires proper response.

### Sentiment:

Sobering, cautionary, selective. Used to warn against complacency, emphasize the seriousness of salvation, or express the tragic reality that many reject God's invitation despite being called.
