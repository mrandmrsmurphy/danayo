### Source / Origin

The exact four-character idiom **人山人海** does not appear in the earliest classics, but it grew organically from **Tang and Song descriptive poetry**.

The imagery of **“mountains of people” (人山)** and **“seas of people” (人海)** both appear separately in early literature to describe festivals, markets, or battle formations.  
By the late imperial period (Ming–Qing), the pairing **人山人海** was established to describe **immense public gatherings** — temple fairs, New Year crowds, or armies on parade.

### Cultural Notes

- **Chinese:** Evokes not only size but also the vitality and collectivity of social life — from festive joy to oppressive chaos.
    
- **Japanese:** _人山人海 (jinzan jinkai)_ is a fixed idiom meaning “teeming with people.”
    
- **Korean:** _인산인해 (insan inhae)_ is extremely common, used in news reports about crowds at holidays or protests.
    
- **Vietnamese:** _Nhân sơn nhân hải_ appears in literature as a poetic hyperbole for “endless masses.”

### Sentiment

> **“A landscape of humanity — vast, surging, alive.”**

Although descriptive, the idiom can carry different tones depending on context:

- **Positive:** Lively, prosperous, communal.
    
- **Negative:** Overcrowded, chaotic, overwhelming.
    

It’s one of those _living idioms_ that remain in daily use across East Asia — from classical hyperbole to everyday report.
