### Source / Origin

The phrase arises from **military writings of the Han and Three Kingdoms periods**, describing literal small forces fighting without reinforcements.  
While no single text first coined the idiom in its modern four-character form, the imagery recurs in chronicles like **《三國志》**, **《後漢書》**, and **《資治通鑑》**, often to praise desperate valor or tragic resistance.

By the late imperial period, **孤軍奮鬥** evolved into a general metaphor for **individual perseverance in adversity**, not only in war but in politics, scholarship, or moral struggle.

A phrase of **heroic isolation**: the image of the lone warrior who, though abandoned, refuses to yield.  
It combines _Confucian loyalty_, _Daoist self-reliance_, and _tragic romanticism_ — the moral courage to fight even when no one else does.
