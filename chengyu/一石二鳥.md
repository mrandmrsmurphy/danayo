**Literal meaning:** “One stone, two birds.”  
**Extended sense:** Achieving two results with a single action; a single effort producing double benefit.

### Source and status
Unlike the previous entries, 一石二鳥 is **not** a Classical Chinese idiom. It is a modern calque of the English proverb “to kill two birds with one stone,” introduced into written Chinese in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century through translation, education, and contact with Western languages. From Chinese, it spread naturally into Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese as part of the shared modern Sino-lexical layer.

### Historical background
There is no premodern Chinese textual source for the phrase. Classical Chinese does contain structurally similar ideas, but not this image. The metaphor of stone-and-birds is distinctly Western, and its adoption marks a shift in how new idioms entered the CJKV sphere: not by poetic citation or historiography, but by translation.

What is notable is how smoothly the phrase naturalized. Its four-character structure fits chengyu norms perfectly, and its causal logic aligns with long-standing pragmatic reasoning in Chinese prose. As a result, it is often mistaken for an ancient idiom despite its modern origin.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 一石二鳥 is fully standard and stylistically neutral. It appears in speech, writing, education, business, and media. Unlike many classical idioms, it carries no literary register and no moral weight beyond efficiency. It simply names an optimization.

### Pronunciations across CJKV
- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _yì shí èr niǎo_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _jat1 sek6 ji6 niu5_
- **Japanese (on-yomi, hiragana):**  
    **いっせきにちょう**
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _il-seok i-jo_ (일석이조)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _nhất thạch nhị điểu_

### Usage note
一石二鳥 is a good example of a “false antique.” Its form signals classical authority, but its history is modern. This makes it useful as a diagnostic case when distinguishing inherited literary idioms from translated conceptual vocabulary.
