### Source / Origin
This cosmological phrase has deep roots in **pre-Qin Chinese thought**, reflecting how early thinkers imagined the shape and structure of the universe.  
Earliest attestations include:

- **《周髀算經》 (The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven)**:    
    > “天圓如張蓋，地方如棋局。”  
    > _“Heaven is round like a stretched canopy; Earth is square like a game board.”_    
- **《淮南子·天文訓》** (Huainanzi, “Treatise on Astronomy”):    
    > “天圓而地方。”  
    > _“Heaven is round and Earth is square.”_    

This became a standard cosmological doctrine in **Han dynasty** natural philosophy, symbolizing the dual order of **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** — the overarching spiritual and the grounded material.

### Cosmological and Philosophical Meaning
**1. Symbolic Geometry:**
- _Heaven (天)_ represents the infinite, transcendent, cyclical, and divine.    
- _Earth (地)_ represents the finite, stable, measured, and human.    
- Their relationship embodies **harmony through complementarity** — roundness for movement and continuity, squareness for order and stability.    

**2. Political Theology:**  
In ritual and imperial symbolism:
- The **Emperor (天子, “Son of Heaven”)** mediated between Heaven (round) and Earth (square).    
- Architecture reflected this:    
    - The **Temple of Heaven (天壇)** in Beijing has a circular altar (for Heaven).        
    - The **Temple of Earth (地壇)** uses a square altar.        

**3. Moral–Metaphysical View:**  
It expresses a worldview where **cosmic order mirrors moral order**.  
Harmony between Heaven and Earth implies harmony in human society, achieved through virtue and ritual.

---
### Cross-Cultural Parallels
- **Greek cosmology** saw celestial spheres (round heavens) surrounding a flat or enclosed Earth — a similar geometric intuition.    
- **Biblical cosmology** (especially Genesis 1 and ancient Hebrew worldview) likewise conceived Heaven as a dome and Earth as flat beneath — so the concept _“Heaven round, Earth flat”_ aligns metaphorically across civilizations.    
- The difference: Chinese _天圓地方_ emphasizes **balance and order**, not creation ex nihilo.    

---
### Cultural Legacy
- Reflected in Chinese **urban planning** (square city layouts aligned to the cardinal directions).   
- **Ritual vessels**: round heaven-offering vessels vs. square earth-offering altars.    
- Common metaphor for _cosmic harmony_ or _the encompassing nature of Heaven’s mandate._ 

Even in modern idiom, **天圓地方** may be used metaphorically for “the structure of the world” or “the natural order of things.”

### Sentiment
> **“Heaven is vast and encircling; Earth is steady and just. From their balance comes order and life.”**
A succinct formula of _cosmic geometry and moral harmony_ — the ancient Chinese vision of the universe, echoed in art, ritual, and governance, and resonant with other ancient sacred cosmologies.
