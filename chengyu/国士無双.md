- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** gwok3 si6 mou4 soeng1    
- **Korean:** 국사무쌍 (_guksa mussang_)    
- **Japanese:** こくしむそう (_kokushi musō_)    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** quốc sĩ vô song    

### Variants

- **Simplified / Traditional:** 国士无双 / 國士無雙
    
- **Related idioms:**
    - 一代英豪 (_a hero of an age_)
    - 絶世無雙 (_unparalleled in the world_)
    - 人中龍鳳 (_a dragon or phoenix among men_)
    - 英雄蓋世 (_a hero who overshadows the world_)
- **Poetic variants:** 無雙國士 (_the peerless hero of the nation_), used especially in verse or eulogy.

### Source / Origin

The idiom originates from the _Records of the Grand Historian_ (《史記·平原君虞卿列傳》) by **Sima Qian** (司馬遷, 1st century BCE).

> 平原君曰：「士之有天下國士，曰毛遂也。」  
> 毛遂曰：「臣聞之：國士無雙。」  
> _Lord Pingyuan said, “Among the scholars of the realm, there is none like Mao Sui.” Mao Sui replied, “I have heard it said: a true national hero is without equal.”_

In this context, Mao Sui (毛遂), an unrecognized retainer of Lord Pingyuan (平原君) during the Warring States period, boldly volunteered to accompany a diplomatic mission. His courage and eloquence secured the alliance of Chu, saving the state of Zhao. His story exemplifies personal valor and the ideal of **the self-made hero** who emerges in crisis.


### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_國士無雙_ expresses the **Confucian ideal of individual virtue and talent in service of the state.**  
A _國士_ (literally “man of the nation”) was not merely a warrior or scholar, but someone of extraordinary ability and integrity whose presence could change the fate of a country.

The phrase is steeped in **Confucian ethics**: the _junzi_ (君子) who acts with courage and righteousness (_yi_, 義) even without recognition, embodying loyalty (_zhong_, 忠) and moral independence.

In a **Daoist reading**, it may also suggest the spontaneity and inner confidence of the sage who acts naturally from the Dao — self-assured yet without pride.  
In **Buddhist** tone, “without equal” (_無雙_) evokes the supreme uniqueness of enlightenment or perfection, as in the epithet “無上正等正覺” (_anuttara-samyak-sambodhi_).

Over time, the idiom evolved from a literal description of a state hero to a metaphor for **peerless excellence in any field** — politics, art, scholarship, or virtue.


### Usage Across Cultures

**Modern Chinese:**  
Used to praise someone of extraordinary ability, moral stature, or irreplaceable character.

> 他才智過人，真可稱為國士無雙。  
> _His talent surpasses all others — truly a peerless hero of the nation._

**Japanese:**  
こくしむそう (_kokushi musō_) is widely used in literature and pop culture — from samurai epics to manga — to describe a warrior or genius unmatched in skill or spirit.

> 彼はまさに国士無双の[[武士]]であった。  
> _He was truly a peerless warrior among the nation’s men._

**Korean:**  
국사무쌍 (_guksa mussang_) retains its classical meaning, often in historical or ceremonial prose:

> 그는 국사무쌍의 인물이었다.  
> _He was a man without equal in the nation._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Quốc sĩ vô song_ appears in historical writing and modern essays, sometimes ironically:

> Trong lịch sử, hiếm ai được gọi là “quốc sĩ vô song”.  
> _In history, few have truly earned the title of “a peerless hero.”_

### Example Usage

1. **Chinese:**  
    韓信之智勇，古今國士無雙。  
    _The wit and valor of Han Xin — unmatched among heroes of all ages._
2. **Japanese:**  
    国士無双の剣士が、乱世に現れた。  
    _A peerless swordsman appeared amid the age of chaos._

### Sentiment

> “The one who stands alone — not above others, but beyond comparison.”
