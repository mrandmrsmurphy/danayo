### Source:

Daniel 2:31-45

> "You saw, O king, and behold, a great image... The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay." (Dan 2:31-33, ESV)

### Examples:

- 但以理解夢,金銀銅鉄示四国相継。(Daniel interpreted the dream: gold, silver, copper, iron showing four kingdoms in succession.)
- 世上諸国如金銀銅鉄,由尊至賤,終必敗亡。(The world's kingdoms are like gold, silver, copper, iron—from noble to base, they will ultimately fall.)

### Cultural Notes:

This phrase captures Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the great statue representing successive kingdoms, each inferior to the last. The descending sequence金(gold)→銀(silver)→銅(copper)→鉄(iron) symbolizes both decreasing value and increasing strength/hardness, reflecting the interpretation that later kingdoms would be militarily stronger but spiritually/morally inferior. The vision culminates with a stone "not cut by human hands" destroying the statue—representing God's eternal kingdom supplanting all human empires. This becomes a key apocalyptic framework in Biblical prophecy.

### Sentiment:

Prophetic, eschatological. Used to reference the succession of earthly kingdoms, the transience of human power, or the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over worldly empires.
