# 信達雅化

**Definition**  
A modern extension of (嚴復) Yan Fu’s famous translation triad **信達雅**. While Yan Fu proposed three criteria for judging translation, **信達雅化** reframes them as an ongoing discipline or cultivated habit. It does not add a fourth evaluative pillar. Instead, it transforms the triad into a principle of formation: the process of making a text faithful, lucid, and refined within the target language.

## Pronunciation (CJKV)

- **Mandarin**: xìn dá yǎ huà
- **Cantonese (Jyutping)**: seon3 daat6 ngaa5 faa3
- **Japanese (On-reading)**: shin-tatsu-ga-ka
- **Korean (Sino-Korean)**: sin dal a hwa
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese)**: tín đạt nhã hoá

Note that in Japanese and Korean, this is not a conventional fixed idiom; it is read transparently by Sino-Xenic pronunciation of each character.

## Historical Background
### The Original Triad: 信達雅
The phrase **信達雅** was articulated by **Yan Fu (1854–1921)** in the preface to his translation of Huxley’s _Evolution and Ethics_ (天演論, 1898). Yan described translation as governed by three difficulties:

- **信 (faithfulness)** — fidelity to the meaning of the original text
- **達 (intelligibility)** — clarity and fluency in the target language
- **雅 (elegance)** — stylistic refinement and literary propriety

Yan emphasized that a translation that is faithful but not intelligible fails in purpose. “If it is not readable, it is as though it were not translated.” For Yan, 達 often required flexibility in syntax and idiom. 雅 reflected his late Qing literary sensibility and his preference for classical prose style.

The triad became foundational in modern Chinese translation theory and continues to frame debates about literalism, readability, and literary style.

## The Addition of 化
The character **化** means transformation, cultivation, or the process of becoming. In modern usage it also functions as a suffix comparable to “-ization,” as in modernization (近代化) or rationalization (合理化).

By appending 化, the phrase shifts from:
- a checklist of criteria  
    to
- a cultivated mode of practice.

Thus **信達雅化** does not propose a fourth coordinate. It raises the entire triad to a meta-level. The concern is no longer merely whether a translation satisfies the three standards, but whether the translator is engaged in the disciplined formation that makes such satisfaction possible.

## Philosophical Significance
### 1. From Standards to Formation
信達雅 evaluates products.  
信達雅化 concerns the formation of the translator.

It moves from output assessment to habitus. Translation becomes a moral-intellectual craft rather than a technical procedure.

### 2. Acknowledging Tension
Faithfulness, clarity, and elegance frequently conflict. 化 recognizes that translation requires trained judgment in navigating trade-offs. The aim is not mechanical balance but principled transformation.

### 3. Translation as Cultural Transplant
Under 化, translation is not mere transfer of semantic content. It is successful transplantation into the ecology of the target language. A text must live naturally within its new linguistic and cultural setting.

## Practical Application
The discipline implied by 信達雅化 can be framed as a recurring process:

1. **Establish 信**  
    Identify the precise claim or function of the original passage. If you cannot summarize its argument clearly, translation should pause.
2. **Secure 達**  
    Test readability with someone who does not know the source language. If comprehension fails, restructure.
3. **Refine 雅**  
    Determine the appropriate stylistic register. Maintain consistency of tone, diction, and rhythm.
4. **Complete 化**  
    Reexamine all adjustments made for clarity or style. Ensure they remain defensible in light of fidelity. Where transformation is necessary, make the rationale transparent.

## Conceptual Position
信達雅化 represents a conservative extension rather than a revision of Yan Fu. It does not replace the triad, nor does it introduce a competing fourth virtue such as precision, relevance, or economy. Instead, it reframes translation as cultivation.

The phrase suggests that translation is not merely an act performed on texts but a long discipline practiced by translators.

In that sense, 信達雅 are virtues.  
信達雅化 is the lifelong practice of becoming capable of them.
