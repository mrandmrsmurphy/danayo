### Source:

Exodus 24:8, Matthew 26:28, Mark 14:24, Luke 22:20, 1 Corinthians 11:25

> "And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you.'" (Ex 24:8, ESV) "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood." (Luke 22:20, ESV)

### Examples:

- 主以血誓盟約,救贖其民。(The Lord by blood-oath covenant redeemed his people.)
- 旧約以牲血立,新約以基督血誓盟約成全。(The Old Covenant was established by sacrificial blood; the New Covenant was fulfilled by the blood-oath covenant of Christ.)

### Cultural Notes:

血誓 (blood-oath) captures the solemnity of covenant ratification through blood, while 盟約 (covenant/sworn agreement) emphasizes the binding mutual commitment. This phrase links the Mosaic covenant at Sinai with Christ's institution of the Eucharist, where he declares "this is my blood of the covenant" (Matt 26:28). The parallelism is foundational to Christian theology: the Old Covenant ratified by animal blood prefigures the New Covenant ratified by Christ's blood. The term resonates with East Asian oath-taking traditions while carrying distinctly Biblical sacrificial theology.

### Sentiment:

Solemn, sacred, covenantal. Used to reference divine covenant, sacrificial atonement, or the sacramental mysteries of faith.
