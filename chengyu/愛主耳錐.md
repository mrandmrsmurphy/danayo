### Source

Exodus 21:5-6, Deuteronomy 15:16-17

> "But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,' then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever." (Ex 21:5-6, ESV)

### Examples

- 僕甘愛主耳錐,終身不離其家。(The servant willingly underwent the ear-piercing out of love for his master, never leaving his household for life.)
- 信徒如愛主耳錐之僕,自願永遠事奉基督。(Believers are like the servant with the ear-piercing of love for the master, voluntarily serving Christ forever.)

### Cultural Notes

愛主 (love-master) captures the servant's voluntary devotion, while 耳錐 (ear-pierce/awl) refers to the physical mark of perpetual servitude. This practice created a visible, permanent sign of willing bondage. In Christian interpretation, this becomes a powerful metaphor for voluntary, loving devotion to God—believers willingly become "bondservants of Christ" (Romans 1:1, Philippians 1:1). The physical mark symbolizes total commitment and joyful surrender rather than coerced slavery.

### Sentiment

Devotional, self-surrendering, covenantal. Used to express voluntary lifelong commitment, joyful servitude to God, or complete dedication born of love rather than obligation.
