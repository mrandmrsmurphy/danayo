> "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Lev 19:18, ESV) "And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Matt 22:39, ESV)

### Examples:

- 基督教人当愛隣如自,不分貴賤親疏。(Christians should love their neighbor as themselves, without distinction of status or relationship.)
- 律法之要義在愛神与愛隣如自。(The essential meaning of the law lies in loving God and loving neighbor as self.)

### Cultural Notes:

愛隣如自 compresses the second great commandment into four characters with elegant economy. 愛隣 (love-neighbor) establishes the object, while 如自 (as-self) provides the radical standard—not mere tolerance or kindness, but love equal to self-love. Jesus identified this (along with wholehearted love of God) as summarizing all the Law and Prophets (Matthew 22:40). The principle implies treating others' needs, dignity, and welfare with the same care and urgency one naturally extends to oneself. This ethic transcends tribal or ethnic boundaries, as illustrated in the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37).

### Sentiment:

Ethical, demanding, compassionate. Used to express the standard of Christian love, call for radical neighbor-regard, or challenge self-centeredness with the golden rule of reciprocal love.
