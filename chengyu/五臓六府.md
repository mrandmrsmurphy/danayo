# 五臓六腑 / 五臟六腑

**Literal meaning:** “The five viscera and six bowels.”  
**Extended sense:** The entire inner body; by extension, one’s whole being, innermost self, or deepest feelings.

### Source and status
Unlike most chengyu, 五臓六腑 is not traceable to a single quotable line. It originates as a technical term within early Chinese medical theory, already well established by the time of **《黃帝內經》** and other Han-period medical writings. Its later idiomatic uses grow out of this technical vocabulary rather than from poetry or historiography.

### Classical background
In traditional Chinese medicine, the _five zàng_ (臓/臟) and _six fǔ_ (腑) refer to functional systems rather than discrete anatomical organs. The category is cosmological and correlative, aligned with yin–yang, the Five Phases, and patterns of circulation and balance. As modern anatomical science displaced this framework, 五臓六腑 ceased to function as a literal medical description. What remained was the phrase itself, fossilized as a holistic image of “everything inside.”

This places the expression awkwardly between lexicon and idiom. It is no longer productive as terminology, yet it has not fully stylized into a proverb. Instead, it survives as a culturally legible bundle of characters whose meaning is grasped intuitively rather than analytically.

### Modern usage
Across CJKV, 五臓六腑 is used metaphorically to mean “the whole body inside,” often with emotional or rhetorical force. Typical collocations involve pain, shock, sincerity, or total exposure, as in speaking from the depths of oneself. It is not used in modern medicine, but it remains immediately intelligible and stylistically neutral to slightly literary.

### Pronunciations across CJKV
- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _wǔ zàng liù fǔ_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _ng5 zong6 luk6 fu2_
- **Japanese:**  
    _gozō roppu_  
    (Often felt as a set phrase rather than analyzable compounds.)
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _o-jang yuk-bu_ (오장육부)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _ngũ tạng lục phủ_

**Lexical note:**  
五臓六腑 is best understood as a relic term: a former piece of technical vocabulary that outlived the theory that gave it precision. What persists is not its original anatomy, but its totalizing force. It names “everything inside” without committing to what, exactly, that “everything” is.
