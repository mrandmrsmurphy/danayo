### Source / Origin

Though not an ancient _chengyu_, _少即是多_ fuses **classical Chinese simplicity** with a **modern aesthetic maxim**, originating from Western modernism and finding deep resonance with traditional East Asian philosophy.

The English phrase _“Less is more”_ was popularized by **Ludwig Mies van der Rohe** (1886–1969), the German modernist architect who distilled beauty into essential form.  
When translated into Chinese as _少即是多_, it struck a profound chord — echoing the ancient Daoist, Confucian, and Zen ideals that _simplicity reveals the essence_.

Its philosophical ancestors include:
> 大道至簡 (Dao De Jing, ch. 48)  
> “The great Way is supremely simple.”
and
> 以少勝多 (Sunzi, _Art of War_)  
> “The few may overcome the many.”

Thus, the idiom bridges **ancient Eastern wisdom and modern Western minimalism**.
### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_少即是多_ embodies the paradox of **emptiness and fullness** — a central theme across Chinese philosophy.

In **Daoism**, “less” means the removal of clutter, desire, and excess to allow the Dao to flow unhindered. Laozi teaches:

> 為學日益，為道日損。損之又損，以至於無為。  
> _In pursuit of learning, one acquires daily; in pursuit of the Dao, one diminishes daily — until one acts without striving._  
> (_Dao De Jing_, ch. 48)

In **Confucian ethics**, moderation (_zhongyong_, 中庸) makes virtue enduring. True refinement is found not in ornament, but in proportion and balance.

In **Zen**, simplicity is enlightenment: when the mind is emptied of attachments, reality shines through. The Zen garden, the single brushstroke, or the silent poem all express “少即是多.”

In modern **aesthetic philosophy**, it teaches that **restraint reveals clarity**, and that **emptiness invites presence** — an ideal shared by both _shibui_ (渋い, quiet beauty) and _wabi-sabi_ (侘寂, graceful imperfection).

### Usage Across Cultures
**Modern Chinese:**  
Used both literally (in art, design, writing) and metaphorically (in ethics, relationships, or leadership).

> 設計不在多，而在精；少即是多。  
> _Design is not about more, but about refinement — less is more._

**Japanese:**  
少ないことは多いこと (_sukunai koto wa ooi koto_) is a common phrase in architecture, Zen art, and tea culture — expressing _侘寂 (wabi-sabi)_ simplicity.

> 茶の湯の美は、少即是多の精神にある。  
> _The beauty of tea lies in the spirit of “less is more.”_

**Korean:**  
소즉시다 (_so jeuksi da_) or _적을수록 많다_ (_the fewer, the greater_) is used in minimalist design and life philosophy.

> 소즉시다, 단순함이 진리를 드러낸다.  
> _Less is more — simplicity reveals truth._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Thiểu tức thị đa_ appears in modern essays on art and spirituality, often tied to Buddhist moderation (_thiểu dục tri túc_ — “few desires, knowing sufficiency”).

> Thiểu tức thị đa – càng giản đơn, càng sâu sắc.  
> _Less is more — the simpler, the deeper._
### Example Usage
1. **Chinese:**  
    少即是多，簡即是美。  
    _Less is more; simplicity is beauty._    
2. **Japanese:**  
    少即是多、静けさの中にすべてがある。  
    _Less is more — within stillness, all things are found._    
### Sentiment
> “In emptiness lies fullness; in simplicity, perfection.”
