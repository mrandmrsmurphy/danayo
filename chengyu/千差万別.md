# 千差万別

**Literal meaning:** “A thousand differences, ten thousand distinctions.”  
**Extended sense:** Extremely diverse; differing in countless ways; great variety with no uniform pattern.

### Source and status
千差万別 does not belong to a single fixed classical citation in the way many chengyu do. It emerges from **medieval to late-imperial literary usage**, especially in expository, philosophical, and Buddhist-influenced prose, where it served as a compact way to gesture at irreducible multiplicity. By the Song period it was already conventional.

### Classical background
差 and 別 overlap semantically but are not redundant. 差 emphasizes deviation or discrepancy; 別 emphasizes distinction or separation. The paired numerals 千 and 万 are not quantitative but rhetorical, marking scale beyond enumeration. The phrase therefore does not merely say “many kinds,” but asserts that variation is intrinsic and pervasive.

This made 千差万別 particularly useful in contexts resisting over-systematization: descriptions of human dispositions, social conditions, phenomena in the world, or doctrinal interpretations. It functions less as an observation than as a warning against simplification.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 千差万別 is widely used in academic writing, journalism, education, and formal speech. It is neutral in tone and analytic in function, often appearing where an author wants to acknowledge complexity before proceeding with classification or argument. It carries no evaluative force by itself.

### Usage note
千差万別 often appears where a writer wants to block premature generalization. It asserts diversity as a starting condition, not a conclusion.
