### Source / Origin
The phrase _日月星辰_ has deep roots in early Chinese cosmology and literature, appearing in the **Book of Documents** (《書經·堯典》), one of the oldest Chinese classics (c. 1000 BCE):

> 敬授人時，日月星辰，敬授民時。  
> _Reverently he (Emperor Yao) regulated the seasons for the people, by observing the sun, moon, stars, and constellations._

In early Chinese thought, _日月星辰_ collectively referred to the **four luminous bodies of heaven**, whose movements established **cosmic order, time, and kingship**. The sovereign’s virtue was measured by harmony with these celestial rhythms.

Later, the phrase appeared frequently in **Han and Tang poetry**, representing both the vastness of creation and the eternal flow of time.  
Du Fu (杜甫) writes in _《登高》_:

> 無邊落木蕭蕭下，不盡長江滾滾來。  
> 日月星辰轉，興亡誰與裁？  
> _The boundless leaves fall, the endless river flows —  
> The sun, moon, and stars turn — who decides rise and fall?_

(_Paraphrased to reflect the idiom’s spirit, not a direct line._)

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning
_日月星辰_ embodies **the cosmic hierarchy and moral symbolism** that underpins Chinese cosmology.

In **Confucian thought**, these celestial bodies symbolize the _Mandate of Heaven_ (天命): the ruler’s virtue should mirror the clarity of the sun, the constancy of the moon, and the orderly procession of the stars. To “align with Heaven” (順天) meant to govern in harmony with these cycles.

In **Daoist philosophy**, they represent the natural spontaneity (_ziran_, 自然) of the universe — the _Dao_ flowing through cosmic motion, unforced and eternal. The Dao De Jing says:

> 天地所以能長且久者，以其不自生，故能長生。  
> _Heaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves; thus they live long._

In **<ruby>佛教<rt>ㄅㄨㄊㄍ˙ㄚㄨ</rt></ruby>**, _日月星辰_ often serve as metaphors for the Buddha’s radiance and the constancy of truth amid the flux of samsara — “as steady as the stars, as bright as the sun.”

In literary and spiritual imagination, the phrase evokes **cosmic beauty, order, and permanence** — a bridge between heaven’s constancy and human transience.

### Usage Across Cultures
**Modern Chinese:**  
Used poetically to refer to the heavens, the natural order, or eternity:

> 日月星辰，見證滄海桑田之變。  
> _The sun, moon, and stars bear witness to the changing seas and fields of time._

**Japanese:**  
じつげつせいしん (_jitsugesseishin_) appears in formal or poetic contexts, evoking grandeur or timelessness:

> 日月星辰は、永遠に天を巡る。  
> _The sun, moon, and stars forever circle the heavens._

**Korean:**  
일월성신 (_ilwol seongsin_) is used in both literature and idioms to signify the universe or divine order:

> 일월성신이 증명하듯, 진리는 변치 않는다.  
> _As the sun, moon, and stars attest, truth does not change._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Nhật nguyệt tinh thần_ occurs in Sino-Vietnamese verse and historical chronicles to express celestial harmony:

> Nhật nguyệt tinh thần chứng giám lòng trung.  
> _May the sun, moon, and stars witness my loyalty._

### Example Usage

1. **Chinese:**  
    日月星辰照四方，天地萬物共生長。  
    _The sun, moon, and stars shine over the four quarters, nurturing all things under heaven._
    
2. **Japanese:**  
    日月星辰の運行は、万物の律動なり。  
    _The movements of the sun, moon, and stars are the rhythm of all creation._

### Sentiment
