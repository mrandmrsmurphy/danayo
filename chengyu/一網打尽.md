**Literal meaning:** “Catch everything in a single net.”  
**Extended sense:** To wipe out or capture all at once; to deal with an entire group in one decisive action.

**Source:**  
Later traditional attributions place the phrase in **《宋史》** 卷三一四, **范純仁傳**. However, lexicographical scholarship, including the _Hanyu Da Cidian_, cites an earlier occurrence in **《東軒筆錄》** 卷四, suggesting that the expression circulated in informal prose before being canonized through historiography.

**Classical background:**  
The image is concrete and tactical. A single cast of the net replaces repeated pursuit. Unlike metaphors of gradual accumulation or moral causation, 一網打尽 emphasizes efficiency, completeness, and finality. Its early appearance in anecdotal and notebook literature fits this tone. It is practical language, not moral exhortation.

When adopted into official histories, the phrase gained retrospective authority. What had been colloquial or descriptive became exemplary, suitable for summarizing decisive political or military outcomes.

**Modern usage:**  
Across the region, 一網打尽 is used in both literal and figurative senses. It appears in law enforcement reporting, military history, business strategy, and everyday speech. The tone is forceful and sometimes aggressive, highlighting total resolution rather than fairness or nuance.

**Usage note:**
