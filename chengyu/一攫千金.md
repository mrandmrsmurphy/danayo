**Literal meaning:** “Seize a thousand pieces of gold in one grab.”  
**Extended sense:** To get rich suddenly; to make a huge profit through a single, often risky or opportunistic act.

### Source
The expression emerges from **late Ming and Qing vernacular literature**, rather than from the classical canon. It belongs to the linguistic world of popular fiction, drama, and anecdotal prose, where commercial life, speculation, banditry, and sudden reversals of fortune were common narrative material.

### Historical background
攫 means to snatch or grab with the hand. The verb is physical and abrupt, unlike verbs of earning or cultivation. When paired with 千金, the image becomes intentionally jarring: enormous wealth obtained without proportional labor. This reflects the social imagination of the late imperial period, when monetization, urban markets, and mobility made sudden enrichment both visible and morally ambiguous.

Because the phrase did not originate in moral philosophy or historiography, it lacks the normative framing typical of earlier idioms. It describes a phenomenon rather than endorsing it. In many contexts, the sudden gain carries an undertone of instability, luck, or dubious means.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 一攫千金 is used to describe speculative success, windfalls, or get-rich-quick schemes. It appears frequently in economic commentary, journalism, and everyday speech. The tone is often skeptical or cautionary, though it can also be descriptive or ironic.

### Pronunciations across CJKV
- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _yì jué qiān jīn_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _jat1 fok3 cin1 gam1_
- **Japanese (on-yomi, hiragana):**  
    **いっかくせんきん**
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _il-gwak cheon-geum_ (일확천금)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _nhất hoạch thiên kim_

**Usage note:**  
一攫千金 contrasts sharply with idioms that praise gradual cultivation or moral causality. Its persistence reflects a social reality that never disappeared: wealth sometimes comes not by process, but by timing.
