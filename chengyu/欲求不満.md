### Source / Origin

While _欲求不滿_ is a **modern compound of classical roots**, each of its parts traces to deep philosophical traditions in East Asia.

_欲_ (_desire_) appears throughout the _Dao De Jing_ and _Buddhist sutras_, often as the central obstacle to peace:

> 無欲則剛。 (_Dao De Jing_, ch. 37)  
> _Without desire, one becomes strong._

_求_ (_to seek_) and _滿_ (_to be full, satisfied_) together create a powerful polarity — **longing versus contentment**, the tension that defines human experience.

The full expression _欲求不滿_ gained prominence in **modern Japanese psychology and sociology** (late Meiji to early Shōwa period, c. 1900–1930), where it translated the Freudian and sociological notion of **“frustrated desire”** (_frustration, Bedürfnisunzufriedenheit_).  
From Japanese it entered modern Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese discourse as both a psychological and moral term.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_欲求不滿_ encapsulates one of the deepest paradoxes of human life — **the endless hunger of the mind and senses**, and the suffering that follows when craving outpaces reality.

In **Confucian ethics**, _desire_ (_yu_, 欲) is not evil in itself, but must be **governed by propriety (禮)** and measured by righteousness (義). Excess desire leads to disorder, both personal and social.

In **Daoist philosophy**, the highest wisdom is _少私寡欲_ — “to have few private desires.” Laozi warns that _欲_ disturbs the balance of the heart and clouds the perception of the Dao. To be “without desire” (_無欲_) is to return to simplicity and inner strength.

In **Buddhism**, _欲求不滿_ is nearly synonymous with _dukkha_ (suffering): the endless wheel of craving and frustration. The Second Noble Truth teaches that suffering arises from _tṛṣṇā_ (渴愛, craving), and liberation comes through detachment.

In modern **psychology and art**, the idiom expresses emotional or existential frustration — not merely greed, but the _restless gap between wanting and being._ It can describe romantic yearning, ambition unfulfilled, or the emptiness of consumer desire.

Thus, _欲求不滿_ bridges moral philosophy and modern psychology: **a diagnosis of the human condition itself.**

### Usage Across Cultures

**Modern Chinese:**  
Used in psychology, literature, and daily speech to mean _frustration_ or _dissatisfaction_.

> 人若被欲求不滿所困，終日不得安寧。  
> _One who is trapped by unfulfilled desire can never find peace._

**Japanese:**  
よっきゅうふまん (_yokkyū fuman_) is a common term in psychology, sociology, and daily conversation. It can mean anything from mild irritation to existential angst.

> 欲求不満が続くと、心が荒んでしまう。  
> _When frustration continues, the heart becomes desolate._

**Korean:**  
욕구불만 (_yokgu bulman_) is used both clinically (for frustration or neurosis) and colloquially (for pent-up dissatisfaction).

> 그는 욕구불만으로 괴로워했다.  
> _He suffered from frustrated desire._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Dục cầu bất mãn_ is used in moral or psychological writing to express the Buddhist view of craving and dissatisfaction.

> Dục cầu bất mãn là nguồn gốc của khổ đau.  
> _Unfulfilled desire is the source of suffering._
