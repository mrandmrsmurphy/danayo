### Examples:

### Cultural Notes:

事事皆旧 compresses Qohelet's philosophical observation about the cyclical, repetitive nature of human existence. The doubled 事事 (thing-thing/everything) emphasizes universality, while 皆旧 (all-old) captures the absence of genuine novelty. This phrase expresses the pessimistic wisdom of Ecclesiastes: human efforts, achievements, and experiences merely repeat patterns established long ago. The sentiment resonates with both Biblical and East Asian cyclical views of history, contrasting with progressive or linear narratives of human advancement.

### Sentiment:

Pessimistic, philosophical, weary. Used to express disillusionment with claims of innovation, emphasize the repetitive nature of history, or convey existential weariness with life's monotony.
