# 佳人薄命

**Literal meaning:** “A beautiful woman has a short life.”  
**Figurative meaning:** Beauty and misfortune often go hand in hand; talented or lovely people tend to meet tragic fates.

### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** jiā rén bó mìng (1–2–2–4)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** gaai1 jan4 bok6 ming6    
- **Korean:** 가인박명 (佳人薄命)    
- **Japanese:** かじんはくめい（佳人薄命）_kajin hakumei_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** giai nhân bạc mệnh 

### Variants
Common poetic variants include:
- **紅顏薄命** (hóng yán bó mìng) – “Beauty (lit. rosy face) has a short fate,” often interchangeable and slightly more common in later usage.    
- **美人薄命** – similar modern form used in vernacular contexts.

### Source / Origin
The sentiment **originates in classical poetry**, especially from **Tang and later dynasties**, where it became a cliché of tragic romanticism.
A clear early example appears in **Cao Pi’s (曹丕, 187–226)** _《燕歌行》_:
> “自古佳人多命薄” — “Since ancient times, beautiful women have been ill-fated.”
The idea was expanded in later literature, such as:
- **Tang poetry**, lamenting the short lives of courtesans and consorts.    
- **Qing fiction**, notably in **Cao Xueqin’s《紅樓夢》** (_Dream of the Red Chamber_), where the author’s preface famously calls his heroines “紅顏薄命之女” — “fair-faced girls of fragile fate.”    

Thus, 佳人薄命 became a shorthand for the tragic destiny of beauty and talent under social constraint — especially female genius oppressed by fate or circumstance.

### Cultural Notes
- In **Chinese** usage, it carries sympathy and melancholy — an aesthetic of _tragedy through beauty_.    
- In **Japanese**, _佳人薄命 (kajin hakumei)_ became a literary idiom during the Edo period, often describing tragic heroines or artists.    
- In **Korean**, _가인박명_ is used proverbially to describe the sad destiny of a gifted or beautiful woman, often in historical dramas or literature.    
- In **Vietnamese**, _giai nhân bạc mệnh_ retains the same sense — “the beautiful woman’s short fate” — and appears in poetry, e.g. describing figures like _Kiều_ in Nguyễn Du’s _Truyện Kiều_. 

### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
自古佳人薄命，紅顏難得長壽。  
_Since ancient times, fair women have had short fates; beauty rarely lives long._

**Japanese:**  
彼女の人生はまさに佳人薄命だった。  
_Her life was truly that of a beautiful woman doomed to a short fate._

**Korean:**  
그녀의 죽음은 가인박명이었다.  
_Her death was a case of “beauty and short fate.”_

### Sentiment
> **“Beauty is fragile; the gifted and the lovely are often fated for sorrow or early loss.”**  
> It expresses both lamentation for impermanence and admiration for fleeting beauty — a deeply East Asian aesthetic combining _tragedy, destiny,_ and _grace_.
