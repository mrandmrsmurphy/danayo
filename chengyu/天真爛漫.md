### Source / Origin

The idiom dates to **Tang–Song dynasty** poetry, though its roots go back to the _Daoist_ concept of **天真 (natural, uncorrupted reality)** — literally “Heaven’s truth.”

- **《莊子·應帝王》:**
    
    > 「至人之心，與天為一。」  
    > _“The perfect person’s heart is one with Heaven.”_  
    > This “Heavenly genuineness” became the philosophical basis for **天真** — the natural, unforced essence of being.
    

The compound **天真爛漫** appears explicitly in later poetic collections such as **明·徐渭《文長集》** and **清·袁枚《隨園詩話》**, describing the _pure beauty of uncontrived nature or personality._

- **爛漫 (lànmàn)** originally meant “luxuriant, brilliant, blossoming in profusion.”  
    → hence “天真爛漫” = _innocence that shines forth like blooming flowers._

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

- **Confucian:** Sincerity and moral simplicity before experience complicates virtue.
    
- **Buddhist:** Original purity of mind before delusion — a quality of enlightenment’s simplicity.
    
- **Modern:** Childlike candor, bright and open personality; genuine rather than naïve.
