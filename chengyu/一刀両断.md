# 一刀兩斷 / 一刀两断

**Literal meaning:** “Cut in two with a single stroke of the blade.”  
**Figurative meaning:** To make a clean break; to sever ties or resolve something decisively and completely.

### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** yī dāo liǎng duàn (1–1–3–4)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** jat1 dou1 loeng5 dyun6    
- **Korean:** 일도양단 (一刀兩斷)    
- **Japanese:** いっとうりょうだん（いっとうりょうだん / 一刀両断）_ittō ryōdan_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** nhất đao lưỡng đoạn 

### Variants
- **Traditional:** 一刀兩斷    
- **Simplified:** 一刀两断    
- Occasionally seen in older texts as 一刀兩斷之決 (“a decision like cutting in two with one stroke”).

### Source / Origin
The expression appears in classical Chinese as a metaphor for resolute or decisive action.  
While it’s not traceable to a single canonical text like many idioms, it reflects a long-standing martial image common in **Han–Tang era literature**, where “one stroke of the sword” symbolized _decisiveness, clarity, and moral firmness_.

It was later adopted into **Buddhist**, **Confucian**, and **military** rhetoric:
- In Zen (Chan) usage, _“to cut through delusion with one sword-stroke”_ refers to sudden enlightenment or a decisive insight (頓悟).    
- In personal or political contexts, it means a **definitive severing of relations** — as in friendship, love, or allegiance.    

### Cultural Notes
- In Japanese, **一刀両断 (ittō ryōdan)** often conveys _“decisive judgment or rejection,”_ such as cutting through falsehood or bureaucracy.    
- In Korean, **일도양단** similarly means to decide clearly without hesitation.    
- In Chinese, it most often connotes _ending a relationship_ — romantic, familial, or political — without lingering ties. 

### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
他終於下定決心，與那家公司一刀兩斷。  
_He finally made up his mind to make a clean break with that company._
**Japanese:**  
彼は過去との関係を一刀両断にした。  
_He severed his ties with the past in one stroke._
**Korean:**  
그는 망설임 없이 일도양단했다.  
_He made a clear, decisive cut without hesitation._

### Sentiment
> **“To end or decide something decisively, cleanly, and irreversibly — like a single sword stroke dividing one into two.”**
