### Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** kōng zhōng lóu gé (1–1–2–2)    
- **Cantonese (Jyutping):** hung1 zung1 lau4 gok3    
- **Korean:** 공중누각 (空中樓閣)    
- **Japanese:** くうちゅうろうかく（空中楼閣）_kūchū rōkaku_    
- **Vietnamese (Hán-Việt):** không trung lâu các    

### Variants
- Traditional: 空中樓閣    
- Simplified: 空中楼阁    
- Common parallel idioms:    
    - **無本之木** — “a tree without roots.”        
    - **鏡花水月** — “flowers in a mirror, moon in water.”        
    - **海市蜃樓** — “mirage.”        
    - **空談無補** — “empty talk that helps nothing.”        

### Source / Origin
The phrase appears first in **Buddhist literature**, later absorbed into general classical usage.
- **《大智度論》卷二十七** (attributed to Nāgārjuna, translated into Chinese c. 4th century CE):    
    > “譬如空中樓閣，雖現似有，實不可得。”  
    > _“Like a pavilion in the air — though it appears to exist, it cannot truly be attained.”_    

In Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy, this image illustrated the _emptiness (śūnyatā)_ of phenomena — all forms are apparent but lack inherent substance.

Later, Confucian and literary writers adopted it to describe **beautiful but baseless theories or projects**.

### Cultural Notes
- **Chinese:** Can be philosophical (_illusory nature of the world_) or practical (_impractical schemes_).    
    - _“這計畫如空中樓閣，不可行。”_ — “This plan is like a pavilion in the sky — unworkable.”        
- **Japanese:** _空中楼閣 (kūchū rōkaku)_ is widely used metaphorically for abstract theories with no grounding in fact.    
- **Korean:** _공중누각_ means the same — “an airy castle,” impractical but often elegant.    
- **Vietnamese:** _Không trung lâu các_ carries both literal and metaphorical meaning: “grand but unreal.”    

### Example Usage
**Mandarin:**  
沒有實際基礎的理論，不過是空中樓閣。  
_A theory without real basis is nothing but a pavilion in the air._

**Japanese:**  
彼の理想は空中楼閣にすぎない。  
_His ideals are no more than a castle in the air._

**Korean:**  
그의 계획은 공중누각이었다.  
_His plan was a tower floating in the air._

**Vietnamese:**  
Giấc mơ ấy chỉ là không trung lâu các mà thôi.  
_That dream was merely a pavilion in the sky._

### Philosophical and Aesthetic Layers
1. **Buddhist:** Reality is transient and insubstantial; what appears beautiful is fundamentally void.    
2. **Confucian:** Theory must rest on practice — otherwise, governance and morality become “air-pavilions.”    
3. **Modern:** Idealism without structure; a warning against visionary but impractical schemes.    

### Sentiment
> **“Lofty yet rootless; dazzling yet empty — a castle built upon air.”**
Together with **鏡花水月**, this idiom forms the classic pair of _illusory beauty metaphors_ in East Asian thought:
> 鏡花水月 — beauty seen but untouchable.  
> 空中樓閣 — grandeur imagined but ungrounded.
