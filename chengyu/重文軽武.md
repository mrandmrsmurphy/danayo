## Classical Sources

The _exact phrase_ is not very early; it seems to **crystallize in Tang–Song historiography**.

### Early Background Ideas

- **《史记·平准书》**: already contrasts “农战之道” (the way of agriculture and war).    
- **《汉书·食货志》**: discusses rulers alternating emphasis between “文治” and “武功.”    
- But the four-character set phrase **重文轻武** does not appear in Han texts.    

### Tang–Song

In Tang/Song commentaries we begin to see this wording. For example:

- **《新唐书·兵志》** (Song compilation, by Ouyang Xiu & Song Qi):
    
    > 国家自古**重文轻武**，武人常被抑。  
    > (Since ancient times the state has esteemed civil over military, and soldiers are often restrained.)
    

This kind of formula becomes common in Song historiography, reflecting the dynasty’s own tendencies.

### Ming–Qing

By Ming and Qing dynastic histories, **重文轻武** is firmly fixed as a standard idiom to critique dynasties (esp. Song) for overvaluing culture and under-preparing militarily.

## 3. Later Usage

- **Historiography:** The Song dynasty is most often described as **重文轻武**.    
- **Modern:** Used in essays or political commentary to describe states/societies that invest too much in soft power, education, or bureaucracy while neglecting defense.    

Example:

> 宋朝**重文轻武**，致使軍事積弱。  
> The Song dynasty esteemed civil affairs and belittled the military, which caused long-standing weakness in war.

# 重文輕武 / 重文轻武

**Literal meaning:** “To value the civil and belittle the martial.”  
**Figurative meaning:** To prioritize culture, education, and moral governance over military strength and warfare; to esteem scholars more than soldiers.

### Variants

- Traditional: 重文輕武
    
- Simplified: 重文轻武
    
- Related expressions:
    
    - **崇文抑武** — “to exalt culture and suppress the military.”

### Source / Origin

The idea originates from **Confucian political philosophy**, which emphasized **moral order, education, and ritual (禮樂)** as the foundation of a stable state.

- **《尚書·武成》** describes King Wu of Zhou conquering by virtue rather than cruelty.
    
- **《論語·子路》**: Confucius says, _“君子文德也。”_ — “The gentleman rules through civil virtue.”
    

By the **Han dynasty**, the civil bureaucracy had come to dominate governance, while the military was viewed as a necessary but lesser instrument.  
The Han, Tang, and Song courts institutionalized this principle: success in the **civil service exams (科舉)** was the primary path to honor and office.

In the **Song dynasty**, _重文輕武_ became a defining policy tendency — scholars held power, while generals were often distrusted after earlier military coups.

### Cultural and Historical Notes

- **Positive connotation (Confucian):** Civilization, learning, and moral leadership bring lasting peace — not brute force.
    
- **Negative connotation (Legalist or modern):** Overvaluing culture weakens national defense and leads to vulnerability.
    

For instance:

- Historians sometimes blame _重文輕武_ for the Song dynasty’s military weakness against northern invaders.
    
- Conversely, the **Ming dynasty** celebrated it as evidence of China’s refined moral order after the Mongol rule.

### Cross-Cultural Parallels

- **Greek:** Plato’s and Aristotle’s debates over the philosopher versus the warrior.
    
- **Biblical:** The triumph of the “word” (λόγος) over the sword — “Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit” (Zechariah 4:6).
    
- **Modern:** “The pen is mightier than the sword.”

### Sentiment

but also a cautionary reminder that _neglect of strength invites peril._
