## Classical Sources

The _exact phrase_ is not very early; it seems to **crystallize in Tang–Song historiography**.

### Early Background Ideas

- **《史记·平准书》**: already contrasts “农战之道” (the way of agriculture and war).    
- **《汉书·食货志》**: discusses rulers alternating emphasis between “文治” and “武功.”    
- But the four-character set phrase **重文轻武** does not appear in Han texts.    

### Tang–Song

In Tang/Song commentaries we begin to see this wording. For example:

- **《新唐书·兵志》** (Song compilation, by Ouyang Xiu & Song Qi):
    
    > 国家自古**重文轻武**，武人常被抑。  
    > (Since ancient times the state has esteemed civil over military, and soldiers are often restrained.)
    

This kind of formula becomes common in Song historiography, reflecting the dynasty’s own tendencies.

### Ming–Qing

By Ming and Qing dynastic histories, **重文轻武** is firmly fixed as a standard idiom to critique dynasties (esp. Song) for overvaluing culture and under-preparing militarily.

## 3. Later Usage

- **Historiography:** The Song dynasty is most often described as **重文轻武**.    
- **Modern:** Used in essays or political commentary to describe states/societies that invest too much in soft power, education, or bureaucracy while neglecting defense.    

Example:

> 宋朝**重文轻武**，致使軍事積弱。  
> The Song dynasty esteemed civil affairs and belittled the military, which caused long-standing weakness in war.
