**Literal meaning:** “Unable to share the same heaven.”  
**Extended sense:** An irreconcilable enmity; a hatred so absolute that coexistence is impossible.

### Source
From **《禮記》**. The phrase appears in ritual and moral discourse concerning blood vengeance and ultimate moral opposition, where certain offenses sever the possibility of shared social or cosmic order.

### Classical background
戴天, “to bear heaven above one’s head,” is a basic image of human existence within an ordered cosmos. To say that two parties 不共戴天 is to deny not merely social harmony but shared placement under the same moral sky. The conflict is framed as total. It is not a dispute to be negotiated, nor a grievance to be settled by compensation.

In the ritual worldview of the _Book of Rites_, such language is reserved for extreme cases, especially those involving kinship violation or grave injustice. The phrase encodes a boundary beyond which reconciliation is no longer ritually or morally intelligible.

### Modern usage
Across the region, 不共戴天 is used to describe enemies whose opposition is fundamental and enduring. It appears in historical narration, political rhetoric, and literary writing. The tone is severe and elevated, and the idiom is rarely used lightly. It signals finality rather than anger.

### Pronunciations across CJKV
- **Mandarin (Putonghua):**  
    _bù gòng dài tiān_
- **Cantonese:**  
    _bat1 gung6 daai3 tin1_
- **Japanese (on-yomi, hiragana):**  
    **ふきょうたいてん**
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):**  
    _bul-gong dae-cheon_ (불공대천)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):**  
    _bất cộng đái thiên_

### Usage note
不共戴天 does not describe intensity of feeling so much as a categorical state. Once invoked, it places the relationship outside ordinary moral repair.
