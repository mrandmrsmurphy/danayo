## Classical Source

### 《孟子·滕文公下》 (Mencius, “Teng Wen Gong II”)

Original passage:

> 孟子謂戴不勝曰：  
> 「子不遠千里而來，亦將有以利吾國乎？」

Translation (Legge):

> _Mencius said to Dai Busheng: “Since you have not considered a thousand li too far to come, you must surely have some way to benefit my state?”_

**Literal meaning:** “Not considering a thousand _li_ to be far.”  
**Extended sense:** Willing to travel great distances out of respect, commitment, or eagerness; valuing a purpose enough that hardship and distance are disregarded.

**Source:** From **《孟子·滕文公下》**, in dialogue involving **滕文公**. The phrase appears as part of Mencius’ moral rhetoric, framing sincere intention as something measured not by convenience but by resolve.

**Classical background:**  
The negation 不遠 does not deny distance as a fact; it denies its moral weight. 千里 stands for an extreme but intelligible effort. Together, the phrase reframes value. What matters is not how far one goes, but why. In Mencian argumentation, this becomes a test of seriousness. Those who truly seek the Way do not calculate inconvenience.

The construction is deliberately understated. Rather than boasting endurance, it normalizes sacrifice. Distance recedes when the aim is rightly ordered.

**Modern usage:**  
Across the region, 不遠千里 is used to commend effort motivated by respect, learning, duty, or relationship. It appears in formal speech, writing, and polite acknowledgment, especially when welcoming guests or praising initiative. The tone is respectful and mildly elevated.
