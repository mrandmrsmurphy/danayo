**Literal meaning:** “One character worth a thousand pieces of gold.”  
**Extended sense:** Writing of exceptional value and precision; words so carefully chosen that even a single character is priceless.

**Source:** From **史記·春申君列傳**. The phrase is associated with the episode in which **呂不韋**, after compiling **呂氏春秋**, displayed the completed work at the gate of Hanyang and publicly offered a thousand taels of gold to anyone who could correct even a single character.

**Classical background:**  
The anecdote is performative as much as literary. The offer was less an invitation to emend than a declaration of confidence. In a culture where texts were copied by hand and authority rested on transmission, claiming immunity from correction was audacious. The hyperbole “一字千金” converts textual exactness into economic value, collapsing scholarship, authorship, and reputation into a single gesture.

The phrase also reflects a transitional moment in intellectual history. The _Lüshi Chunqiu_ was a syncretic work, attempting to gather and systematize rival schools of thought. The boast of uncorrectability stakes a claim not merely to elegance, but to comprehensive adequacy.

**Modern usage:**  
Across the region, 一字千金 is used to praise writing, editing, or speech marked by extreme concision and weight. It appears in literary criticism, education, and rhetoric, often to commend careful wording or authoritative formulation. The tone is admiring and formal.

**Usage note:**  
Unlike expressions that praise verbosity or ornament, 一字千金 exalts restraint. Its ideal is not abundance of words, but density of meaning, where alteration would diminish rather than improve the whole.
