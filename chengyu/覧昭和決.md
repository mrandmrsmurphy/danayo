# 覧昭和決

## Literal meaning
“Examine Shōwa and decide.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
The principle that visual form and orthographic standards are to be determined by practical evaluation rather than ideological alignment. In the context of Dan’a’yo, the idiom refers specifically to the adoption of Shinjitai-style character forms as a visual compromise: simplified enough to improve legibility and learning speed, yet conservative enough to preserve continuity with the classical written tradition.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** lǎn zhāo hé jué 
- **Cantonese:** laam5 ziu1 wo4 kyut3
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** らんしょうわけつ
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 람소화결 (ram so-hwa gyeol)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** lãm chiêu hòa quyết

## Notes on scope and tone
覧昭和決 is evaluative rather than historical in intent. 昭和 functions metonymically, pointing to a period in which script reform sought balance rather than rupture. 覧 emphasizes inspection and comparison, while 決 signals an explicit design choice. The idiom situates orthography as a matter of usability and inheritance, rejecting both maximal simplification and full traditionalism. Its tone is technical and policy-oriented, appropriate for sections of a manifesto dealing with script standards, typography, and visual continuity across the CJKV sphere.
