### Source / Origin
The phrase _春夏秋冬_ is as ancient as Chinese civilization itself, representing **the fourfold rhythm of nature and time**. It appears in early classics such as the _Book of Documents_ (《書經·洪範》):

> 五行：一曰水，二曰火，三曰木，四曰金，五曰土。  
> 春生，夏長，秋收，冬藏。  
> _The five elements are: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. In spring things are born, in summer they grow, in autumn they are harvested, in winter they are stored._

Thus, the sequence _春夏秋冬_ is not merely calendrical but **cosmic** — the visible manifestation of Heaven’s rhythm (_天道_), the pattern through which _qi_ (氣) flows and life renews.

The _Classic of Poetry_ (《詩經·小雅》) also celebrates this harmony:

> 春日遲遲，卉木萋萋。  
> _The spring days linger, the grasses grow thick and green._  
> Each season is imbued with moral and emotional symbolism — **spring as birth**, **summer as vigor**, **autumn as decline**, **winter as rest**.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning
_春夏秋冬_ encapsulates the Chinese understanding of **cyclical time** — not linear progress or decay, but rhythmic return.

In **Confucian cosmology**, it represents the order (_li_, 理) of Heaven and Earth: the ruler who governs according to the seasons acts in harmony with _Heaven’s mandate_ (天命).

In **Daoist philosophy**, it illustrates _wu wei_ (無為): the principle of acting in accord with nature. Just as spring’s growth and winter’s stillness follow their own timing, so should human life follow the effortless flow of the Dao.

In **<ruby>佛教<rt>ㄅㄨㄊㄍ˙ㄚˇ</rt></ruby>**, the four seasons are metaphors for impermanence (_anitya_, 無常): everything changes, perishes, and is reborn — yet within this flux lies a deeper constancy.

Thus, the phrase is both **a natural calendar** and **a moral allegory**: the world’s endless cycle mirrors the rise and fall of empires, the aging of the body, and the renewal of the spirit.
### Usage Across Cultures
**Modern Chinese:**  
Used literally for the seasons, or metaphorically for the passage of time and life’s rhythm.

> 春夏秋冬，人生如四季。  
> _Spring, summer, autumn, and winter — life itself has its seasons._

**Japanese:**  
しゅんかしゅうとう (_shunka shūtō_) is widely used in poetry, seasonal aesthetics, and even branding to evoke _mono no aware_ (物の哀れ) — the gentle sadness of passing beauty.

> 春夏秋冬の移ろいに、人の心も変わる。  
> _With the shifting of the seasons, so too does the human heart change._

**Korean:**  
춘하추동 (_chunha chudong_) appears in literature and proverbs, symbolizing continuity and endurance.

> 춘하추동이 바뀌어도, 그리움은 여전하다.  
> _Though the seasons change, my longing remains._

**Vietnamese:**  
_Xuân hạ thu đông_ is used in poetry and folk sayings, often to mark the transience of life or love:

> Xuân hạ thu đông, bốn mùa luân chuyển, lòng người chẳng đổi.  
> _Spring, summer, autumn, winter — the four seasons turn, but the heart remains._
### Example Usage
1. **Chinese:**  
    春夏秋冬，寒暑代謝，惟德不變。  
    _Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter — cold and heat succeed one another, but virtue does not change._    
2. **Japanese:**  
    春夏秋冬の花鳥風月、すべては無常の歌なり。  
    _The flowers, birds, wind, and moon of the four seasons — all sing the song of impermanence._    
### Sentiment
> “All things bloom, fade, and rest — yet the circle is never broken.”
