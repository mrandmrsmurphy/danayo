### Pronunciation:

- Mandarin: jiā fēn bù lì
- Cantonese: gaa¹ fan¹ bat¹ laap⁶
- Korean: ga bun bul lip (가분불립)
- Japanese: ka bun fu ritsu (カブンフリツ)
- Vietnamese: gia phân bất lập

### Variants:

- 家若分争、必站不住 (fuller Classical Chinese rendering)
- Traditional form would be identical in this case

### Source:
_Matthew 12:25, Mark 3:25, Luke 11:17 (Synoptic Gospels)_

> "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand." (Matt 12:25, ESV)

## Examples:

- 教会家分不立,当求合一之道。(If the church is divided against itself, it must seek the way of unity.)
- 此国家分不立,终必败亡。(This nation divided against itself will ultimately fall.)

### Cultural Notes:
This phrase adapts Jesus's teaching on internal division to the four-character chengyu format. The structure 家分不立 uses 家 (house/household) as the subject, 分 (divided) as the state, and 不立 (cannot stand) as the consequence—mirroring the logical structure common in Chinese philosophical maxims.

### Sentiment:
Warning, cautionary. Used to emphasize the necessity of unity and the dangers of internal conflict.
