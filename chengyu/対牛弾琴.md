  First attested in c. 3rd century CE in the story of the Warring States-era musician Gongming Yi (公明儀) playing the zither to a cow, recorded in Mouzi Lihuolun. Mouzi used this example to illustrate the correct way to explain Buddhism to people with Confucian backgrounds.

### Source / Origin
The idiom originates in **《莊子·外物》 (Zhuangzi, “Outer Things”)**, a Daoist text from the 4th century BCE.

Zhuangzi wrote:

> 「伯牙鼓琴而牛聞之，止食，舉頭不顧。非牛不聞也，牛不解也。」  
> _“Bo Ya played the qin; the cow stopped eating, raised its head, but showed no understanding. It’s not that the cow didn’t hear — it simply didn’t understand.”_

Later moralists and poets condensed this to the phrase **對牛彈琴**, turning Zhuangzi’s fable into a proverb about _incommunicable wisdom._

### Cultural Notes

- **Chinese:** Describes futile communication — when one’s refined art or reasoning meets uncomprehending dullness. Can be humorous or disdainful.
    
    - Example: “跟他談哲學，簡直是對牛彈琴。”  
        _Talking philosophy with him is like playing the qin to a cow._
        
- **Japanese:** _対牛弾琴 (taigyū dankin)_ is a recognized _yojijukugo_, identical in meaning.
    
- **Korean:** _대우탄금 (daeu-tangeum)_ or its vernacular equivalent _소에게 거문고 타다_ are used proverbially for futility in communication.
    
- **Vietnamese:** _Đối ngưu đàn cầm_ has the same sense, used in scholarly or poetic contexts.
    

**Buddhist texts** also adopted the idiom, comparing it to _“explaining the Dharma to those without ears to hear.”_  
This makes it conceptually parallel to **Matthew 7:6** — _“Do not cast your pearls before swine.”_ Both express the futility and desecration of sharing sacred truths with the unreceptive.

### Sentiment
> **“Wisdom offered to the unwise; beauty wasted on the unhearing.”**

Daoist in origin, satirical in tone, and universal in truth — **對牛彈琴** expresses the melancholy of unappreciated eloquence, the same human ache behind the biblical _“pearls before swine.”_
