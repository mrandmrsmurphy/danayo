# 詞彙兼容

**Literal sense:** “Vocabulary accommodates inclusively.”  
Or more precisely: “The lexicon is capable of inclusion.”

## Structure
- **詞彙** — vocabulary, lexical stock
- **兼** — concurrently, inclusively, without exclusion
- **容** — to contain, receive, admit

The phrase asserts that a living cultural tradition does not purge its lexicon when schools differ. It absorbs.

## Philosophical Force
Under [[百家共承]], traditions inherit from one another.  
Under 詞彙兼容, that inheritance is lexical.

It means:
1. Competing schools may use overlapping terminology.
2. The same word may carry layered histories.
3. Vocabulary need not be purified to preserve identity.

It pushes against linguistic sectarianism.

## Cultural Implication
A civilization confident in itself can:
- borrow terms
- retain archaic expressions
- allow semantic accretion

Instead of demanding terminological quarantine, it tolerates semantic density.

This is historically visible in:
- Confucian terms adopted into Buddhist discourse
- Buddhist terms reinterpreted in Neo-Confucianism
- Western philosophical vocabulary naturalized into modern Sinitic usage

The lexicon becomes a shared field, not a fenced territory.

## Boundary Question
兼容 does not mean semantic collapse. It does not imply that distinctions disappear. It implies capacity to host difference without lexical fragmentation.

The test is whether shared vocabulary remains intelligible despite divergent metaphysical commitments.

### Pronunciations
**Mandarin:** cí huì jiān róng  
**Cantonese (Jyutping):** ci4 wui6 gim1 jung4  
**Japanese (hiragana, on-reading):** し い けん よう  
**Korean (Hangul, Sino-Korean):** 사 휘 겸 용  
**Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** từ vựng kiêm dung


If 百家共承 is civilizational continuity,  
詞彙兼容 is linguistic permeability.
