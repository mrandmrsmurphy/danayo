### Source / Origin

The idiom originates in the **Han dynasty** text _Huainanzi_ (《淮南子·氾論訓》), a syncretic Daoist-Confucian classic compiled in the 2nd century BCE:

> 五日一風，十日一雨，然後禾稼成熟。  
> _When there is a breeze every five days and a rain every ten, the grain ripens well._

The phrase described the ideal pattern of natural cycles — **neither drought nor flood**, **neither windstorm nor stagnation** — a climate of moderation and balance that ensured abundance.

Over time, _五風十雨_ came to symbolize **political harmony and social peace**, under the belief that the virtue of the ruler brings Heaven’s favor, and Heaven’s favor manifests in mild, timely weather.

### Cultural & Philosophical Meaning

_五風十雨_ expresses the ancient Chinese conviction that **cosmic harmony and moral virtue are intertwined**.

In **Confucian cosmology**, the state of the heavens mirrors the state of the realm. When the ruler governs with virtue (_德治_), the _qi_ of Heaven and Earth flows smoothly — gentle winds and timely rains bless the people.  
Thus, “five winds and ten rains” became an **omen of benevolent rule**, the meteorological signature of a _sage-king’s_ reign.

In **Daoist philosophy**, it illustrates _自然之道_ — the Way of nature’s self-regulation. Neither excess nor deficiency, but cyclical renewal: movement balanced by stillness, abundance tempered by restraint.

In **Buddhist interpretation**, the phrase evokes the **Middle Way** (_中道_), harmony between extremes. The “wind” of change and the “rain” of nourishment together sustain all living beings — symbols of compassion (karuṇā) and wisdom (prajñā).

Through centuries of poetry and governance, _五風十雨_ came to signify **the ideal world order** — not a utopia of grandeur, but a gentle, self-sustaining peace in which nature and humanity breathe in rhythm.
