### 優柔不断

**Literal meaning:** “Gentle and yielding, yet unable to decide.”  
**Extended sense:** Indecisive; overcautious to the point of paralysis; unable to act despite reflection.

**Source:** From **《後漢書》**, **杜林傳**. In its original setting, the phrase functions as a character judgment, part of the Han historiographical habit of diagnosing political and moral failure through compact personal descriptors.

**Classical background:**  
The term is built from two evaluative halves. 優柔 does not originally mean weakness. It denotes softness, patience, and consideration. 不断, however, marks a failure of resolution. The criticism is therefore subtle. The problem is not lack of thought but excess of it, a temperament that values harmony and caution but cannot cross the threshold into decision.

This nuance matters. 優柔不断 is not rashness, ignorance, or cowardice. It is the failure mode of a reflective person in situations that demand commitment.

**Modern usage:**  
Throughout the region, the idiom is used to describe people, leadership styles, or processes that stall because of hesitation. It appears in political commentary, management critique, and personal evaluation. The tone is negative but measured. It suggests frustration rather than moral condemnation.

**Usage note:**  
The idiom often carries an implicit contrast with decisive virtues valued in Confucian and administrative traditions. It criticizes not thoughtfulness itself, but the inability to translate judgment into action when circumstances demand it.
