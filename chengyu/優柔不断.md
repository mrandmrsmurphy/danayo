## Classical Sources

The earliest occurrences are in **Han historiography**:

### 《後漢書·杜林傳》 (Book of the Later Han, “Biography of Du Lin”)

> 林少以經術顯名，然為人**優柔不斷**。

> _Du Lin was known in his youth for his scholarship, but as a man he was indecisive, unable to make firm decisions._

This is the **canonical source** of the idiom.

## Variant: 優柔寡斷

By the Tang and Song periods, the more common form became **優柔寡斷**, meaning exactly the same thing (寡斷 = lacking decisiveness).

For example, **《舊唐書·王毛仲傳》**:

> 毛仲性**優柔寡斷**。

So today both forms exist, but dictionaries often list **優柔寡斷** as the “main” idiom, with **優柔不断** as an early variant.
