Mark 12:30, Luke 10:27 (cf. Deuteronomy 6:5)

### Examples:

- 愛神当尽心性意力,無有所留。(To love God one must exhaust heart, soul, mind, and strength, holding nothing back.)

### Cultural Notes:

This four-character structure elegantly captures the four dimensions of total devotion commanded in the Greatest Commandment. 心 (heart/emotional center), 性 (soul/essential nature), 意 (mind/will/intention), and 力 (strength/physical capacity) together represent the totality of human being and capability. The compression into chengyu form emphasizes completeness and integration—true love of God encompasses every aspect of personhood.

### Sentiment:

Devotional, comprehensive. Used to express total commitment, whole-person dedication, or the integrated nature of genuine faith.
