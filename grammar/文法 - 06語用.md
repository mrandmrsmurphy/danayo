## Style
The guiding maxim for pragmatics and stylistic breadth in Dan’a’yo is **【<ruby>[[百家共承]]<rt>ㄅㄚㄎㄐㄚㄍ˙ㄛㄥㄙㄨㄥ</rt></ruby>】** (“All schools jointly inherited”). This motto reflects the language’s deliberate openness: the lexicon and registers of Dan’a’yo are drawn from the full range of East Asian tradition and modernity alike.

Two principles flow from this maxim:
1. **【<ruby>[[詞彙兼容]]<rt>ㄙㄚㄏㄨㄍㄝㄇ·˙ㄛㄥ</rt></ruby>】** — lexical inclusivity, welcoming terms from every school of thought and every cultural source.    
2. **【<ruby>[[文体並存]]<rt>ㄇㄨㄋㄊㄝㄧㄅㄝㄥㄐㄛㄋ</rt></ruby>】** — stylistic coexistence, allowing classical elegance, formal clarity, and modern brevity to share one framework.    

Thus **【<ruby>[[百家共承]]<rt>ㄅㄚㄎㄐㄚㄍ˙ㄛㄥㄙㄨㄥ</rt></ruby>】** makes explicit the pragmatic philosophy of Dan’a’yo: not to limit itself to one lineage, but to acknowledge and inherit them all in common.

## Translation
The guiding maxim for translation and loanword practice in Dan’a’yo is **【<ruby>[[義重於音]]<rt>ˇㄧㄥㄑㄛㄥ·ㄛㄇ·ㄨㄇ</rt></ruby>】**. This motto rejects the fragile practice of phonetic transcription, which varies across regions and shifts over time, in favor of semantic clarity.

A principles flow from this maxim:
- **<ruby>[[義以立名]]<rt>ˇㄧ·ㄧㄌㄧㄆㄇㄧㄥ</rt></ruby>** — names should be established by meaning, conveying identity or quality that endures across languages.    

Thus **【<ruby>義重於音<rt>ˇㄧㄥㄑㄛㄥ·ㄛㄇ·ㄨㄇ</rt></ruby>】** enshrines the translation policy of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>: **semantic transparency ensures stability and mutual comprehension**, whereas phonetic imitation risks confusion and obsolescence.

Historically, Confucius said "names should follow their bearers, while things should follow China" (名從主人，物從中國). In other words, names should be transliterated, while things should be translated by meaning.  We generally agree with the statement, but must face the reality that using hanji in the transliteration is unstable.

We make the modern motto into a Chengyu: **【<ruby>[[信達雅化]]<rt>ㄙㄧㄋㄊㄚㄊ·ㄚㄏˇㄚ</rt></ruby>】**
