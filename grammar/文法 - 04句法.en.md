# Syntax

## Modes of Syntax
Dan'a'yo has significantly different grammars for its three different modes of usage.  They roughly correspond to poetry, online, and norma.

### Classical Style
**【[[先題後述]]】**

Classical Style is the most concise and elevated mode of Dan’a’yo. It deliberately echoes the terseness of Classical Chinese, omitting copulas and particles whenever possible and favoring compact topic–comment phrasing. In this mode, composition often employs **Chinese Characters only**, without ruby, in imitation of the ancient standard. Such writing is especially suited to **poetry and aphorism**, where brevity and resonance are prized.

At the same time, Classical Style admits a second face: the **訓読古雅** mode. Here, Dan’a’yo functions as a _kanbun-style overlay_ upon authentic Classical Chinese texts. The base text remains in its original literary form, while ruby provides syntactic guidance, recasting the clauses into Dan’a’yo grammar. (Apparati exist to decorate CC text in ways that allow emendation of additional characters, modified word-order, and phonetic transcription.) This dual function allows Classical Style both to **generate new compositions in a venerable style** and to **interpret the classical canon within a modern IAL framework**.

Thus 古雅体 is not merely an archaizing affectation, but a **living bridge**: it connects Dan’a’yo to the deep textual heritage of the Sinosphere while enabling its speakers to engage directly with those texts.

### Online Style

網語体 is the **fastest and most economical mode** of Dan’a’yo. It reflects the realities of digital communication, where technical constraints or platform norms may restrict writing to **<ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> only** (most common) or, more rarely, to **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> only**.

In this mode, **subject–verb–object order dominates**. The older topic–comment structure is rarely used, since clarity depends on the immediacy of SVO sequencing. **Grammatical particles**—case markers, connectives, and even copulas—are dropped wherever context makes their function obvious. The result is a clipped, elliptical style that maximizes **speed of input** and **ease of recognition** on small screens.

網語体 also pushes **pro-drop to the limit**: pronouns, topics, and even objects are omitted whenever recoverable from context. A single verb or adjective can carry an entire utterance, especially in fast back-and-forth exchanges.

Thus 網語体 is not careless but **context-driven**, relying on shared knowledge and situational cues. It represents Dan’a’yo as it lives in the immediacy of modern communication—**stripped, agile, and efficient**.

### Literary Style

>[!tip]
>The guiding maxim for the orthography of 書面体 is **【[[文音共決]]】** (“Script and sound resolved together”). This motto affirms that **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> must appear together** in Literary mode: the written form (文) provides semantic precision, while the phonetic gloss (音) guarantees accessibility.
>
> Two principles flow from this maxim:
>
>1. **文以定義** — script clarifies meaning, preserving the depth and authority of the Han tradition.    
>2. **音以達読** — sound ensures readability, allowing all learners to pronounce and understand without ambiguity.    
>
>Thus **【文音共決】** enshrines the policy of dual orthography in Literary Dan’a’yo: **neither <ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> nor ruby stands alone**, but both together secure the clarity and reach of the language.

書面体 is the **standard and authoritative mode** of Dan’a’yo, designed for clarity, precision, and mutual intelligibility across the CJKV sphere. Where 古雅体 is compact and 網語体 is clipped, 書面体 is **fully explicit**. It preserves the elegance of the classical tradition while adapting it to the expectations of modern grammar.

Key features include:

1. **Copular constructions.** When both topic and comment are **名詞**, a copula (是/非) is required. E.g. <ruby>我<rt>ㄚ</rt></ruby> <ruby>是魚<rt>ㄙㄝㄧㄛ</rt></ruby>。 “I am a fish.”
2. **Nominalization.** When **評詞 (verbs)** or **性詞 (statives)** serve as topics, they must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物. E.g. _保持事 平常_ “Maintaining is common.”
3. **Verbal completeness.** 評詞 are considered **incomplete without an object**; a transitive verb must show its argument. Ellipsis is far less tolerated here than in other modes.
4. **TAM marking.** Tense–aspect–mood suffixes such as -已 (perfective), -中 (progressive), and -将 (prospective) are not optional; they are **highly encouraged** and regularly employed.
5. **Adnominals.** Modifiers must attach with **之**, preserving the classical written convention. E.g. _走之馬_ “great person.”
6. **Case-marking.** Postpositions are required. Omitting 于, 於, 由, etc., is considered ungrammatical in this mode.
7. **Sentence-final particles.** All non-declarative sentences must end with a **sentence-final particle** (乎, 矣, 哉, etc.) to mark interrogation, exclamation, or modality.
8. **Adverbial placement.** Adverbs and adverbial phrases are typically placed **immediately before the verb**, in canonical East Asian fashion.
9. **Orthography.** Both **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> ruby** are required whenever possible. This dual representation ensures accessibility and disambiguation across audiences.
10. **Determiners.** Names, technical terms, and obscure words must be followed by a **限定詞** in written texts to mark them clearly (阿, 鳥, 虫, 服, etc.).


In sum, 書面体 embodies **grammatical conservatism and explicitness**. It is the mode for scholarship, formal correspondence, and inter-CJKV communication. Where 古雅体 preserves concision and 網語体 embraces speed, 書面体 provides the **normative baseline**: the form every learner must master, and the register in which Dan’a’yo most fully expresses its dual inheritance.

## Meta–Parts of Speech
The grammar of Dan’a’yo organizes all words into **three great classes** (_meta–parts of speech_). Each class has its own internal subcategories, which are treated in turn.

### Content Words
Content words are the **core vocabulary of Dan’a’yo**. They name entities, describe states, and express events. Unlike function words (助詞) or special words, any content word can serve as either **topic** or **comment** in a clause. Four major subtypes are recognized: 名詞, 評詞, 性詞, and 繋詞.

#### Nouns
Nouns refer to persons, things, and concepts (_神, 人, 母親_).

- In **書面体 (Literary mode)**, a noun cannot serve as the **comment** by itself when paired with another noun; it requires a **copula**.    
    - _我 是魚_ — “I am a fish.”        
- Otherwise, nouns may freely serve as **topics** without further marking.

#### Eventives
Eventives are **transitive verbs** (_創造, 捕, 行_), denoting actions or processes.

- An Eventive requires **both subject and object**. It is incomplete without its complement.    
    - _神 創造 世界_ — “God created the world.”        
- When an object is absent, a **passive prefix** (_被_) may license the form:    
    - _世界 被創造_ — “The world was created.”        
- As modifiers, Eventives must attach to nouns with **之**:    
    - _走之馬_ — “the running horse.”        
- As **comment**, Eventives are expected and natural.    
- To serve as **topic**, Eventives must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物:    
    - _創造事 艱難_ — “Creation is difficult.”

#### Statives
Statives are **qualities or intransitives** (_白, 大, 暴怒_). They bridge the categories of adjective and verb.

- Like adjectives, 性詞 may **modify nouns directly** without 之:    
    - _大人_ — “great person.”        
- Like verbs, they may serve as **comment** without a copula:    
    - _天 高_ — “The sky is high.”        
- To serve as **topic**, statives require the suffix -物:    
    - _高物 難測_ — “Height is difficult to measure.”

#### Copulas and Existentials
繋詞 form a small but crucial class that overlaps noun, verb, and function.

- **Transitive copulas**: 是, 非, 有, 無.    
    - They take an explicit complement (_我 是魚_; _此 非道_).        
- **Intransitive copulas**: 在, 莫.    
    - They indicate existence or location (_人在於地_), or negation (_莫能為_).        
- Because of their hybrid function, 繋詞 are classified under Content Words but behave like **grammatical pivots** in syntax.

### Functions Words
Function words are the **grammatical operators** of Dan’a’yo. They cannot themselves serve as **topic** or **comment**, but they bind, modify, or frame the content words. Most are short, frequent, and either suffixing or prefixing depending on type.

#### Relators
Relators are modeled on Japanese and Korean postpositions. They attach after nouns or noun phrases to mark their **syntactic role**.

- Almost all relators are **suffixing**.    
- Examples:    
    - **于** — dative / locative         
    - **哉** — vocative (_父哉!_ “O Father!”)        
    - **丈** — restrictive “only” (_一人丈_ “only one person”)        
    - **且** — additive “also” (_我且行_ “I also go”)        
    - **就** — delimitative “just, precisely” (_此就道_ “this is just the way”)        

#### Modifiers
Modifiers include **prefixing particles** that alter, restrict, or frame the meaning of content words. They can express deixis, negation, potentiality, or degree.

- Most modifiers are **prefixes**.    
- Examples:    
    - **不** — negation (_不行_ “not go”)        
    - **可** — potential (_可行_ “can go”)        
    - **已** — perfective (_行已_ “has gone”)        
    - **未** — negative perfective (_未行_ “has not gone yet”)        
    - **此 / 其 / 彼** — proximal, medial, distal deixis.        

#### Pronouns
代詞 stand in for other nouns or noun phrases, and include persons, demonstratives, and correlatives. They are not inflected but follow a regular correlative system.

- Examples:    
    - **我** — first person singular.        
    - **君** — second person singular.       
    - **誰** — interrogative “who.”        
    - **何** — interrogative “what.”        
    - **此, 其, 彼** — demonstratives (also used deictically as 修飾語).        

#### Sentence-final Particles
SFPs here are distinct from the copular Content Words. They occur at the end of a clause and mark **mood, modality, or emotion**.

- Examples:    
    - **[[乎 (char)]]** — interrogative particle (_汝行乎?_ “Do you go?”)        
    - **[[矣]]** — emphatic (_已行矣_ “Why has he gone?!")        
    - **[[哉]]** — negative alarm (also vocative)
    - **[[也]]** - exclamative
    - **[[哇]]** - wow
    - **[[該]]** – should, ought
    - **[[別]]** – do not
    - **[[勿]]** – do not ever
    - **[[夫]]** – right?, isn't it?
    - **[[請]]** – please
    - **[[就]]** – let
    - **[[了]]** – done, over, copy
    - **[[似 (char)]]** – it's as if ...

#### Conjunctions
Conjunctions link clauses, phrases, or even whole texts. They are frequent and indispensable in extended discourse.

- Examples:    
    - **<ruby>而<rt>ㄋㄧ</rt></ruby>** — coordinating “and, but.”        
    - **<ruby>与<rt>˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>** - 'and' for nouns
    - **乃** — consequential “therefore, then.”        
    - **雖** — concessive “although.”        
    - **若** — conditional “if.”

### Special Words
Special Words are **independent forms** that play crucial roles in counting, classification, determination, and emotive expression, yet they are **never predicative**. Unlike Content Words, they cannot serve directly as topic or comment, and unlike 助詞, they do not operate on syntax. Instead, they stand apart as **auxiliary but indispensable elements** of discourse.

#### Numerals
Numerals express number and order (_一, 二十, 三百_). They combine productively with classifiers to form counting phrases.
- **Cardinals:** 一, 二, 三…
- **Tens, hundreds, thousands:** 十, 百, 千…    
- **Ordinals:** formed with 第 (_第一_ “first”).    

#### Classifiers / Measure Words
 In Dan’a’yo, number is not usually specified. A bare noun phrase (NP) may refer to one or more items depending on context. When **explicit numerals** are required, they follow the NP, and must themselves be followed (without a space) by a **classifier (量詞)**, which categorizes the NP in order to express number.

> **Rule:**  
> NP + Numeral + Classifier

Classifiers are a set of twelve words (see table below) which group nouns into semantic categories (people, animals, machines, books, etc.). A noun phrase with classifier is always **definite**.

Examples
1. **有 犬三匹。**    
    - **Gloss:** have dog three-ANIMAL        
    - **Meaning:** “(I) have three dogs.”        
2. **肋骨六条 与 歯五個 被砕已。**    
    - **Gloss:** rib six-LONG + tooth five-MISC passive-break already        
    - **Meaning:** “Six ribs and five teeth were broken.”

- In spoken style, the numeral + classifier is tightly bound, without pause.    
- Different classifiers reflect the shape, animacy, or function of the noun:    
    - **匹** (animals), **条** (long-thin), **冊** (books), **台** (machines), **杯** (cupfuls), etc.        
- The “miscellaneous” classifier **個** may be used when the category is unclear.

| Character | Class          | Examples                                |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 人        | people        | any person without reference to status   |
| 名        | people (name) | deferential term for person              |
| 台        | machines      | computers, cars, blenders, nanobots      |
| 匹        | animals       | cat, elephants, mice, platypuses         |
| 冊        | books         | books, magazines, newspapers, ezines     |
| 杯        | cupfuls       | glass of water, shots of alcohol         |
| 枚        | flat things   | pizza, paper, plywood                    |
| 条        | long, thin    | pencils, noodles, fingers                |
| 段        | time intervals| seconds, days, years                     |
| 番        | times         | turns, happenings, repeats               |
| 束        | bundles       | groups, bouquets, bales                  |
| 個        | misc.         | anything else                            |
   

#### Determiners
Determiners clarify **semantic domains** of nouns, especially proper names, rare words, and ambiguous references. They are required in **書面体** after names and technical terms.

- Examples:    
    - **阿** — personal names         
    - **鳥** — birds         
    - **虫** — insects         
    - **服** — clothing         

#### Interjections
Emotive particles that stand alone as full utterances, expressing feeling or reaction.

- Examples: **哎**, **唉**, **嗚**, **おお**, **아**.    

#### Ideophones / Sound-symbolics
Express sound, manner, or sensory vividness, often reduplicated or stylized.

- Examples:    
    - **嘩** — a crash.        
    - **軣軣** — roaring.        
    - **滴滴** — dripping.        
    - **きらきら**, **반짝반짝** — sparkling.
