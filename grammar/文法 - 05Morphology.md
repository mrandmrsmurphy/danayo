Morphology in Dan’a’yo consists of **prefixes, suffixes, postpositions, and reduplication** that alter the form or function of content words (実詞). These processes do not create new lexical roots but instead **mark grammatical roles, derive new syntactic functions, or adjust aspect and degree**. Unlike function words (助詞), which remain independent, morphological elements are **bound forms**: they attach to a host word or phrase.

The guiding maxim for Dan’a’yo morphology is **形助顯理** (“Form helps reveal structure”). This motto highlights how bound forms — prefixes, suffixes, and postpositions — function as **helpers (助)** that make the underlying **principle (理)** of the sentence visible.

Two principles flow from this maxim:
1. **Aid through attachment （附形之助）** — small forms bind to content words to indicate case, aspect, modality, or relation, ensuring clarity across the sentence.    
2. **Revelation of structure （顯句之理）** — what is implicit in Classical Chinese or Vietnamese becomes explicit, while Japanese and Korean intuitions about particles are carried into a new SVO framework.    

Thus **形助顯理** expresses the balance that defines Dan’a’yo morphology: seemingly minor affixes and particles act as **guides to structure**, ensuring that the language’s classical roots and modern functions remain transparent to all learners.

## Nominal Morphology （名詞形態）

### 等 — Associative Plural （等・連体複数）
Most Asian languages （東亜諸語） do not indicate **grammatical number** （文法的数）. The suffix **等** is not a simple plural marker （単純複数標識）, indicating merely “more than one.” Instead, it functions as an **associative plural** （連体複数）, showing that the main object named by the noun phrase （名詞句主項） is expanded to include others associated with it （連帯対象）.

This usage is comparable to English expressions such as _et al._ or _etc._ （英語「et al」「etc」に相当）, rather than the ordinary plural ending _-(e)s_ （英語複数接尾辞）.

In Dan’a’yo （単亜語）, there is not a separate class of **personal pronouns** （人称代名詞）, but two words take **等** in a special way.

- **我** (“I, me”) + **等** → **我等** = “we” （我等 = 我々）    
- **君** (“you (singular)”) + **等** → **君等** = “you (plural)” （君等 = 諸君）    

These are the only true plural words （真正複数語） in Dan’a’yo, apart from **mass nouns** （集合名詞） which are inherently plural.

### 公 — Politeness Marker （公・敬語標識）

The suffix **公** attaches directly to **noun phrases** （名詞句） and adds a sense of **austerity and politeness** （厳粛・敬意）. Dan’a’yo （単亜語） does not preserve the complex politeness systems （敬語体系） of Japanese （日本語） or Korean （韓国語）. In general:

- **Shorter words and sentences** （短文） sound intimate and familiar （親密・親しみ）.    
- **Longer forms** （長文） sound more polite and distant （丁寧・疎遠）.    

Certain titles （称号） require added formality, and **公** fulfills this role （形式強化）.

As in all cultures （普遍文化原則）, **formality stands in tension with intimacy** （丁寧と親密の対立）. Once a close relationship has been established （親密関係成立）, a return to politeness （丁寧再導入） is rude and distant （無礼・疎遠）.

**Example:** At the start of a school year （学年初）, students would naturally call their teacher  **先生公**, since they do not yet have a personal bond （個人的関係未成立）. Later, when speaking of their own teacher among friends （友人間言及）, they would simply say **先生** — distinguishing “our teacher” from others, without the added formality （教師差別化・形式不要）.

### Restrictive Suffixes （制限接尾辞）

Dan’a’yo has three **restrictive suffixes** （制限接尾辞）:

- **丈** “only” 
- **且** “too / also”     
- **就** “just / merely”    

These suffixes attach directly to **noun phrases** （名詞句）. Importantly, they do **not transform the NP into an adverb** （副詞化しない）. The phrase remains a subject or topic （主題・主語） of the sentence, while carrying the restrictive meaning.

#### Examples （例文）

1. **丈 “only”**
- 連傑丈 市場於 購買。  
    _“Only Jet buys at the market.”_    
- 我之描丈 寺院於 睡眠。  
    _“Only my cat sleeps at the temple.”_
1. **且 “too, also”**
- 医生且 市場於 販売。  
    _“The doctor also sells (things) at the market.”_    
- 我之描且 木曜日於 嬉遊。  
    _“My cat also plays on Thursday.”_	
1. **就 “just, merely”**
- 連傑就 寺院於 閲読。  
    _“Jet just reads at the temple.”_    
- 医生就 市場於 食。  
    _“The doctor simply eats at the market.”_

## Reduplication （畳語法）

## 等級法 (Degrees of Comparison)
In Dan’a’yo, adjectives and stative verbs do not inflect for degree. Instead, degree is expressed analytically, through particles and adverbs. This structure parallels the practice of CJKV languages, but with Dan’a’yo’s distinctive SVO order and preference for postpositions.

### 1. **Equative (Equality)**
- **如** is used to mark equative comparisons: “as … as.”
    
- Structure: **A  B如 Adj**    
- Example:    
    - 我 君如 高。        
    - _I am as tall as you._
        
- Extended form with **同** may also appear for emphasis:
    
    - 我如君同高。
        
    - _I am the same height as you._

### 2. **Comparative (Superiority/Inferiority)**

- **比** marks the standard of comparison: “than.”
    
- Structure: **A B比 更 Adj**
    
- Example:
    
    - 我君比更好。
        
    - _I am better than you._
        
- The particle **更** “more” is optional but often appears for clarity.
    
- Inferiority can be expressed with **不如**:
    
    - 我不如君高。
        
    - _I am not as tall as you._ (= “less tall than you”)
        

---

### 3. **Superlative (Greatest Degree)**

- The universal marker is **第一** “the first, foremost,” paralleling literary Chinese and Japanese.
    
- Structure: **A 第一 Adj**
    
- Example:
    
    - 此山第一高。
        
    - _This mountain is the tallest._
        

---

### 4. **Superlative of Inferiority (Least)**

Dan’a’yo has no inherited Classical form for “least,” but several strategies are plausible:

1. **以最不…** → “the most not…”
    
    - 他以最不智。
        
    - _He is the least wise._
        
2. **末一** (parallel to 第一, but “last, lowest”):
    
    - 此人末一強。
        
    - _This person is the least strong._
        
3. **第一少…** → “the foremost in smallness
