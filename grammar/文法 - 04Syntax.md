> [[単亜語之文法書 Grammar]]

The guiding maxim for Dan’a’yo syntax is **文言現代** (“Classical and Contemporary”). This motto highlights the dual inheritance （二重伝統） of Dan’a’yo: the **paratactic structure of Classical Chinese** （文言句法, Classical syntax） and the **SVO grammar of modern East Asian languages** （現代語文法, 主語–動詞–目的語構造）.

The motto emphasizes two principles:

1. **Continuity with the classical written standard** （文言承継） — preserving topic–comment structure （主題–述部構造） and concision （簡潔性）.    
2. **Adaptation to modern speech** （現代適応） — requiring verbs in every clause （述語必須） and maintaining subject–verb–object order （SVO語順）.    

Thus **文言現代** expresses the balance （均衡） that defines Dan’a’yo syntax （単亜語句法）: rooted in the authority of the classical tradition, yet usable in the context of modern communication.

## Modes of Syntax **句法之式**
Dan'a'yo has significantly different grammars for its three different modes of usage.  They roughly correspond to poetry, online, and norma.

### 古雅体 (Classical Style)

古雅体 is the most concise and elevated mode of Dan’a’yo. It deliberately echoes the terseness of Classical Chinese, omitting copulas and particles whenever possible and favoring compact topic–comment phrasing. In this mode, composition often employs **kanji only**, without ruby, in imitation of the ancient standard. Such writing is especially suited to **poetry and aphorism**, where brevity and resonance are prized.

At the same time, 古雅体 admits a second face: the **訓読古雅** mode. Here, Dan’a’yo functions as a _kanbun-style overlay_ upon authentic Classical Chinese texts. The base text remains in its original literary form, while hangul ruby provides syntactic guidance, recasting the clauses into Dan’a’yo grammar. (Apparati exist to decorate CC text in ways that allow emendation of additional characters, modified word-order, and phonetic transcription.) This dual function allows 古雅体 both to **generate new compositions in a venerable style** and to **interpret the classical canon within a modern IAL framework**.

Thus 古雅体 is not merely an archaizing affectation, but a **living bridge**: it connects Dan’a’yo to the deep textual heritage of the Sinosphere while enabling its speakers to engage directly with those texts.

### 網語体 (Online Style)

網語体 is the **fastest and most economical mode** of Dan’a’yo. It reflects the realities of digital communication, where technical constraints or platform norms may restrict writing to **hangul only** (most common) or, more rarely, to **kanji only**.

In this mode, **subject–verb–object order dominates**. The older topic–comment structure is rarely used, since clarity depends on the immediacy of SVO sequencing. **Grammatical particles**—case markers, connectives, and even copulas—are dropped wherever context makes their function obvious. The result is a clipped, elliptical style that maximizes **speed of input** and **ease of recognition** on small screens.

網語体 also pushes **pro-drop to the limit**: pronouns, topics, and even objects are omitted whenever recoverable from context. A single verb or adjective can carry an entire utterance, especially in fast back-and-forth exchanges.

Thus 網語体 is not careless but **context-driven**, relying on shared knowledge and situational cues. It represents Dan’a’yo as it lives in the immediacy of modern communication—**stripped, agile, and efficient**.

### 書面体 (Literary Style)

書面体 is the **standard and authoritative mode** of Dan’a’yo, designed for clarity, precision, and mutual intelligibility across the CJKV sphere. Where 古雅体 is compact and 網語体 is clipped, 書面体 is **fully explicit**. It preserves the elegance of the classical tradition while adapting it to the expectations of modern grammar.

Key features include:

1. **Copular constructions.** When both topic and comment are **名詞**, a copula (是/非) is required. E.g. _我 是魚_ “I am a fish.”
    
2. **Nominalization.** When **評詞 (verbs)** or **性詞 (statives)** serve as topics, they must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物. E.g. _保持事 平常_ “Maintaining is common.”
    
3. **Verbal completeness.** 評詞 are considered **incomplete without an object**; a transitive verb must show its argument. Ellipsis is far less tolerated here than in other modes.
    
4. **TAM marking.** Tense–aspect–mood suffixes such as -已 (perfective), -中 (progressive), and -将 (prospective) are not optional; they are **highly encouraged** and regularly employed.
    
5. **Adnominals.** Modifiers must attach with **之**, preserving the classical written convention. E.g. _走之馬_ “great person.”
    
6. **Case-marking.** Postpositions are required. Omitting 于, 於, 由, etc., is considered ungrammatical in this mode.
    
7. **Sentence-final particles.** All non-declarative sentences must end with a **sentence-final particle** (乎, 矣, 哉, etc.) to mark interrogation, exclamation, or modality.
    
8. **Adverbial placement.** Adverbs and adverbial phrases are typically placed **immediately before the verb**, in canonical East Asian fashion.
    
9. **Orthography.** Both **kanji and hangul ruby** are required whenever possible. This dual representation ensures accessibility and disambiguation across audiences.
    
10. **Determiners.** Names, technical terms, and obscure words must be followed by a **限定詞** in written texts to mark them clearly (阿, 鳥, 虫, 服, etc.).
    

In sum, 書面体 embodies **grammatical conservatism and explicitness**. It is the mode for scholarship, formal correspondence, and inter-CJKV communication. Where 古雅体 preserves concision and 網語体 embraces speed, 書面体 provides the **normative baseline**: the form every learner must master, and the register in which Dan’a’yo most fully expresses its dual inheritance.

## Meta–Parts of Speech （語類之大別）

The grammar of Dan’a’yo organizes all words into **three great classes** (_meta–parts of speech_). Each class has its own internal subcategories, which are treated in turn.

## 実詞 (Content Words)
Content words are the **core vocabulary of Dan’a’yo**. They name entities, describe states, and express events. Unlike function words (助詞) or special words (特詞), any 実詞 can serve as either **topic** or **comment** in a clause. Four major subtypes are recognized: 名詞, 評詞, 性詞, and 繋詞.

### 名詞 (Nouns)
Nouns refer to persons, things, and concepts (_神, 人, 母親_).

- In **書面体 (Literary mode)**, a noun cannot serve as the **comment** by itself when paired with another noun; it requires a **copula**.    
    - _我 是魚_ — “I am a fish.”        
- Otherwise, nouns may freely serve as **topics** without further marking.

### 評詞 (Eventives)
Eventives are **transitive verbs** (_創造, 捕, 行_), denoting actions or processes.

- A 評詞 requires **both subject and object**. It is incomplete without its complement.    
    - _神 創造 世界_ — “God created the world.”        
- When an object is absent, a **passive prefix** (_被_) may license the form:    
    - _世界 被創造_ — “The world was created.”        
- As modifiers, 評詞 must attach to nouns with **之**:    
    - _走之馬_ — “the running horse.”        
- As **comment**, 評詞 are expected and natural.    
- To serve as **topic**, 評詞 must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物:    
    - _創造事 艱難_ — “Creation is difficult.”

### 性詞 (Statives)
Statives are **qualities or intransitives** (_白, 大, 暴怒_). They bridge the categories of adjective and verb.

- Like adjectives, 性詞 may **modify nouns directly** without 之:    
    - _大人_ — “great person.”        
- Like verbs, they may serve as **comment** without a copula:    
    - _天 高_ — “The sky is high.”        
- To serve as **topic**, statives require the suffix -物:    
    - _高物 難測_ — “Height is difficult to measure.”

### 繋詞 (Copulas and Existentials)
繋詞 form a small but crucial class that overlaps noun, verb, and function.

- **Transitive copulas**: 是, 非, 有, 無.    
    - They take an explicit complement (_我 是魚_; _此 非道_).        
- **Intransitive copulas**: 在, 莫.    
    - They indicate existence or location (_人在於地_), or negation (_莫能為_).        
- Because of their hybrid function, 繋詞 are classified under 実詞 but behave like **grammatical pivots** in syntax.

## 助詞 (Function Words)
Function words are the **grammatical operators** of Dan’a’yo. They cannot themselves serve as **topic** or **comment**, but they bind, modify, or frame the content words (実詞). Most are short, frequent, and either suffixing or prefixing depending on type.

### 関詞 (Case Markers / Postpositions)
関詞 are modeled on Japanese and Korean postpositions. They attach after nouns or noun phrases to mark their **syntactic role**.

- Almost all 関詞 are **suffixing**.    
- Examples:    
    - **于** — dative / locative (_於地_ “on the earth”)        
    - **哉** — vocative (_父哉!_ “O Father!”)        
    - **丈** — restrictive “only” (_一人丈_ “only one person”)        
    - **且** — additive “also” (_我且行_ “I also go”)        
    - **就** — delimitative “just, precisely” (_此就道_ “this is just the way”)        

### 修飾語 (Modifiers)
修飾語 include **prefixing particles** that alter, restrict, or frame the meaning of content words. They can express deixis, negation, potentiality, or degree.

- Most 修飾語 are **prefixes**.    
- Examples:    
    - **不** — negation (_不行_ “not go”)        
    - **可** — potential (_可行_ “can go”)        
    - **已** — perfective (_已行_ “has gone”)        
    - **未** — negative perfective (_未行_ “has not gone yet”)        
    - **此 / 其 / 彼** — proximal, medial, distal deixis.        

### 代詞 (Pronouns)
代詞 stand in for other nouns or noun phrases, and include persons, demonstratives, and correlatives. They are not inflected but follow a regular correlative system.

- Examples:    
    - **我** — first person singular.        
    - **君** — second person singular.       
    - **誰** — interrogative “who.”        
    - **何** — interrogative “what.”        
    - **此, 其, 彼** — demonstratives (also used deictically as 修飾語).        

### 繋詞 (Sentence-final Particles)
繋詞 here are distinct from the copular 実詞. They occur at the end of a clause and mark **mood, modality, or emotion**.

- Examples:    
    - **乎** — interrogative particle (_汝行乎?_ “Do you go?”)        
    - **矣** — perfective or emphatic (_已行矣_ “He has indeed gone.”)        
    - **哉** — exclamative (_大哉!_ “How great!”)        

### 接詞 (Conjunctions)
接詞 link clauses, phrases, or even whole texts. They are frequent and indispensable in extended discourse.

- Examples:    
    - **而** — coordinating “and, but.”        
    - **乃** — consequential “therefore, then.”        
    - **雖** — concessive “although.”        
    - **若** — conditional “if.”
