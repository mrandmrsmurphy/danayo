> [[単亜語之文法書 Grammar]]

The guiding maxim for Dan’a’yo syntax is **文言現代** (“Classical and Contemporary”). This motto highlights the dual inheritance （二重伝統） of Dan’a’yo: the **paratactic structure of Classical Chinese** （文言句法, Classical syntax） and the **SVO grammar of modern East Asian languages** （現代語文法, 主語–動詞–目的語構造）.

The motto emphasizes two principles:

1. **Continuity with the classical written standard** （文言承継） — preserving topic–comment structure （主題–述部構造） and concision （簡潔性）.    
2. **Adaptation to modern speech** （現代適応） — requiring verbs in every clause （述語必須） and maintaining subject–verb–object order （SVO語順）.    

Thus **文言現代** expresses the balance （均衡） that defines Dan’a’yo syntax （単亜語句法）: rooted in the authority of the classical tradition, yet usable in the context of modern communication.

## Modes of Syntax **句法之式**
Dan'a'yo has significantly different grammars for its three different modes of usage.  They roughly correspond to poetry, online, and norma.

### 古雅体 (Classical Style)

古雅体 is the most concise and elevated mode of Dan’a’yo. It deliberately echoes the terseness of Classical Chinese, omitting copulas and particles whenever possible and favoring compact topic–comment phrasing. In this mode, composition often employs **kanji only**, without ruby, in imitation of the ancient standard. Such writing is especially suited to **poetry and aphorism**, where brevity and resonance are prized.

At the same time, 古雅体 admits a second face: the **訓読古雅** mode. Here, Dan’a’yo functions as a _kanbun-style overlay_ upon authentic Classical Chinese texts. The base text remains in its original literary form, while hangul ruby provides syntactic guidance, recasting the clauses into Dan’a’yo grammar. (Apparati exist to decorate CC text in ways that allow emendation of additional characters, modified word-order, and phonetic transcription.) This dual function allows 古雅体 both to **generate new compositions in a venerable style** and to **interpret the classical canon within a modern IAL framework**.

Thus 古雅体 is not merely an archaizing affectation, but a **living bridge**: it connects Dan’a’yo to the deep textual heritage of the Sinosphere while enabling its speakers to engage directly with those texts.

### 網語体 (Online Style)

網語体 is the **fastest and most economical mode** of Dan’a’yo. It reflects the realities of digital communication, where technical constraints or platform norms may restrict writing to **hangul only** (most common) or, more rarely, to **kanji only**.

In this mode, **subject–verb–object order dominates**. The older topic–comment structure is rarely used, since clarity depends on the immediacy of SVO sequencing. **Grammatical particles**—case markers, connectives, and even copulas—are dropped wherever context makes their function obvious. The result is a clipped, elliptical style that maximizes **speed of input** and **ease of recognition** on small screens.

網語体 also pushes **pro-drop to the limit**: pronouns, topics, and even objects are omitted whenever recoverable from context. A single verb or adjective can carry an entire utterance, especially in fast back-and-forth exchanges.

Thus 網語体 is not careless but **context-driven**, relying on shared knowledge and situational cues. It represents Dan’a’yo as it lives in the immediacy of modern communication—**stripped, agile, and efficient**.
