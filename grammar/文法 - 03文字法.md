> The guiding maxim for <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> orthography is **【<ruby>[[覧昭和決]]<rt>ㄌㄚㄇㄐㄛˇㄏˇㄚㄎˇㄝㄊ</rt></ruby>】**. This recalls the 正字改革 carried out in Japan during the [[昭和]]<ruby>時代<rt>ㄙㄧㄉㄚ˙</rt></ruby>, 1926–1989）, which produced the system of **<ruby>新字体<rt>ㄙㄧㄋㄐㄧㄊㄝㄧ</rt></ruby>**. These [[簡略]][[字形]] balanced [[可読]]性 with [[継承]]性, standing between [[繁体字]] and the far-reaching [[簡体字]].
> 
> By adopting 日本式簡字, 単亜語 establishes a consistent [[視覚]][[標準]] that is shared and accessible across [[中日韓越]][[地域]].
>
> The motto emphasizes two principles:
> 1. **Japanese orthography as the compromise form** （[[日本]][[正字]][[折衷]]） — midway between traditional and simplified.    
> 2. **Visual uniformity across the script** （文字視覚統一） — so that texts are recognizable to all readers （普遍可読）.    
>
>Thus **【<ruby>[[覧昭和決]]<rt>ㄌㄚㄇㄐㄛˇㄏˇㄚㄎˇㄝㄊ</rt></ruby>】** stands as a Classical reminder that the authority for the _look_ of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> （字形権威） is derived from the Shōwa reforms.

# 文字法
単亜語 is written with 新字体 漢字.  Above each character appears a phonetic transcription （音訓標） in <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨˇㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚˇ</rt></ruby> letters , set in the style of ruby glosses （振り仮名法）.  The [[発音]] of each character is derived in regular fashion （規則的） from [[中古]][[漢語]].  This derivation aims to stand at equal distance （[[均衡]]） from the modern pronunciations （[[近代]][[諸音]]）, yet it shows a marked bias （[[偏重]]） toward Middle Korean （[[中古]][[韓語]]）.  In principle, the character form （[[文字]]） and the alphabetic form （[[字母]]） hold equal weight （[[並立]]）.  Yet, within restrictive media （[[制約]][[媒介]]）, one form may prevail （[[偏勝]]） over the other.

## 文字規範

- **【<ruby>[[一字一音]]<rt>ㄧㄊㄐㄧㄧㄊㄚㄇ</rt></ruby>】 One Character, One Sound**
  Every Chinese character （漢字） has one, and only one, pronunciation （音）.

- **【<ruby>[[毎字明意]]<rt>ㄇㄛㄧㄐㄧㄇㄧㄝㄥㄧ</rt></ruby>】 Per Character, Bright Meaning**
  Every character has a single meaning （[[義]]）. Metaphorical derivations （[[譬喩]][[義派]]生） are permitted. Distinction between new meaning and extended metaphor allows natural word formation （[[造語]]）. This accords with the historical tradition （[[傳統]]） of semantic derivation （[[義派生]]） in the region.

- **【[[単語熟語]]】 Simple Character, Familiar Speech**
  Some characters are [[単語]] when standing alone. Others require companions, forming [[熟語]]. In vocabulary terms, there are [[一字]] words and [[双字]] words.

- **【<ruby>[[四字成語]]<rt>ㄙㄧㄧㄐㄧㄙㄧㄥㄧㄛ</rt></ruby>】 Four-Character Phrases**
  Certain fixed expressions （[[慣用句]]） are set in [[四字]]. They form a shared idiom across East Asia （[[東亜]][[慣用]]）. Each country also developed innumerable unique phrases （[[国別]][[成語]]）, which are not a shared heritage.

These rubrics direct the writing system toward 明晰 by multiplying characters （多字化）.  At the same time, 単亜語 follows a contrary impulse: to reduce the number of characters （減字化） as far as possible.  The higher aim （高旨） of the language is to maintain the minimum set of characters that still ensures clarity （簡而明）.  In practice, this requires a core of about 2,000 characters （常用字）.  Each core character may gather its 異体字 and 古形 under one head.  This follows the same practice as Japanese substitute characters （[[代用]]字） and Chinese simplified characters （簡化字）.

## 文字之[[階]]
More than fifty thousand Chinese characters （漢字五万餘字） have been recorded in history.  
In 単亜語 these are divided into six categories （六類）:  常用字, 先進字, 名字, 違法字, 異体字, 借代字, and 無類字.  Characters that fall outside national standards （国定標準） and official name lists （姓名表） are judged too rare （[[稀少]]） to categorize.  By this restriction, the practical inventory （[[実際]][[字庫]]）of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> stands at slightly under four thousand characters （四千字未満）.

**Figure 3.1: <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> Character Score Points**

| 漢語等級 | Points | 教育等級 | Points | 特別用字 | Points | 韓国用字 | Points |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 漢語一級 | 303    | 教育一級 | 299    | 教育五級 | 206    | 韓国중学 | 401    |
| 漢語二級 | 248    | 教育二級 | 277    | 教育六級 | 179    | 韓国高校 | 222    |

| 漢語四級 | 111    | 教育四級 | 223    | 人名用字 | 99     |      |        |


### 常用字
**【[[日用必備]]】 Daily Use, Always Needed**

About two thousand characters （二千字） are classed as 常用字.  They form the basic building blocks （基礎要素） of the language.  They are usable everywhere （遍用） without explanation or limitation （無制限）. This body of characters defines the volume necessary for fluency （通達必要量） in <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>.  It is subdivided into six graded sets （六級） called educational characters （教育漢字）.  These graded sets facilitate learning by newcomers （初心学習）.  Outside of textbooks （教科書） and children’s literature （児童文献）, the six-fold divisions are not recognized （不施行）.

### 先進字
Advanced characters （先進字） are drawn from literary sources （文献） and difficult words （難語） beyond the two thousand common characters （常用字）.  In 単亜語文, such characters must be introduced （提示） and defined （釈義）.  This requirement may be set aside （省略） when the audience is not general （非普遍読者）.  An advanced character may be reclassified （転類） as a naming character （名字字） when used in a proper name （姓名） or species designation （物種名）.

### 名字
Naming characters （名字） are used in technical names （術名） of animals （禽獣）, places （地名）, persons （人名）, anatomical parts （身体名）, and related categories （諸類）.  They are not used in ordinary discourse （常談） except when referring to those exact things （指定事物）.  When first introduced in a text （初見）, a naming character should be followed by a determiner （定詞）. A character may be designated as naming （名字指定） but also appear in advanced words （先進語）.  In such cases, its classification shifts （転類） from one designation to the other （類移）.

### 違法字
Forbidden characters （違法字） are expressly disallowed （明禁） in <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>.  They may belong exclusively to one nation （一国専用）.  They may also stand in direct competition （競合） with a common character （常用字）. This category, though unfortunate （不幸）, is necessary for the simplicity of the language （簡明之為）.  Every forbidden character in another country （他国用字） has a direct substitute （代用字） within <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>.  A complete list （全表） is given in [[文法 - 98違法字]].

### 異体字
**【[[異体不容]]】** - Every character has only one acceptable form. 

Nearly every Chinese character （漢字） has been written in multiple ways （多形） across nations （諸国） and across time （歴代）.  Such forms are called variant characters （異体字）.  Ideally, an input system （入力法） will recognize a variant when typed, and replace it with the standardized glyph （正体字）.

This system sometimes produces striking results （奇観）.  Obscure characters that are homophones or near-homophones （同音字） of common characters （常用字） may be reclassified as variants （転属）.  This removes the statistical “long tail” （冗尾） of ultra-rare characters （稀字）.

For example, the phrase **魑魅魍魎** is visually impressive （観之壮）.  Yet the last two characters, 魍 and 魎, have almost no independent usage （孤用）.  By fiat （擬制）, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> declares 魍 a variant of 罔, and 魎 a variant of 両.  These two are in fact components of the originals （構件）.  Thus the idiom therefore appears as **[[魑魅罔両]]**, equally expressive but more economical （簡而存義）.

### 無類字
Unclassified characters （無類字） lie outside all lists （諸表外）.  They are too rare （稀少） to be assigned a category （不可分類）.  They appear only in dictionaries （字書） or historical records （古録）.

For practical purposes （実用上）, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> does not admit them into the active inventory （現用字庫）.  They are studied for reference （参照） but not employed in writing （不用）.

## 音源推定
The pronunciation system of 単亜語 is based on 中古漢語.  The Zhengzhang Shangfang rime table （鄭張尚芳韻表） serves as the primary reference （本表）.  
Consensus reconstructions （通説） are followed in general.

A rule-of-thumb table for initials （声母） and finals （韻母） is given in Appendix B （附録乙）.  
From these rules, each character receives a systematic pronunciation （規則的音）.  When the resulting syllable would be overfull （過繁）, adjustments are made （調整）.  For example, the character 殆 would yield ㄉㄚ˙, but <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> follows the Cantonese form _doi_ to avoid excess homophony.

Korean influence also guided certain choices （韓音所助）.  Many historical ㄙㄧ syllables （詞） became ㄙㄚ in <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>, reflecting Middle Korean shifts （中古韓語変化）.

Occasionally, rare characters were selected solely for their sound value （以音取字）.  For example, 耽 is used to supply ㄉㄛㄇ.  In some cases, inspiration came from unusual Vietnamese readings （越音異読）.  Thus 𦚖 provides the syllable ㄇㄛㄆ, otherwise unattested.

Through such measures, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> establishes a balanced and functional sound system （均衡而可用之音系）.

## 新字体
Over the 近百年, many reforms of Chinese characters （文字改革） have been proposed and implemented.  中国大陸 adopted the most radical 簡化, and a further scheme was rescinded in 1986.  Because many such simplifications depend on Mandarin pronunciation （官話音）, they are not equally usable across nations （域内通用性に欠く）.  Some countries retained traditional forms unchanged （旧体不改）.  The Japanese system of **新字体** offers a moderate middle path （折衷之道） suitable for 単亜語.

### 例外規定
- **龍 / 竜**  
    <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> writes **龍** in all contexts.  
    The simplified **竜** is avoided for cross-regional clarity （容易混同亀）.    
- **圓 / 円**  
    The semantic term “circle” uses **圓**.  
    The Shinjitai **円** is closely associated with currency （通貨） and is not used for the geometric sense.    
- **弗部の整序**  
    <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> regularizes the 弗 component （弗部）: write **佛** not 仏, and **拂** not 払.    
- **[[桌]] / [[卓]]**      
	- These are distinguished to preserve **【毎字明意】**（一字一義）.    
- **干 / 乾** 
	- **干** “desiccate; interfere” and **乾** “heavenly; Qian-trigram” remain distinct.
- **果 / 菓**  
    These are **conflated** as in Chinese usage; **菓** is treated as a variant of **果**.
- **貳 / 弍**  
    Standard form is **貳**.  
    **弍** is avoided due to proximity to **弌／弎**.
- **缺 / 欠**  
    These differ in both sound and meaning; they remain distinct.

### 拡張新字体
Shinjitai in practice is not fully consistent （一貫を欠く）.  <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> therefore applies **extended Shinjitai** where possible, seeking **component-wise consistency （部件一律）** without loss of meaning.

Principles （簡化原則）:
1. **Component parity （部件同処）**: when a component is simplified in one common character, comparable occurrences are simplified in parallel.    
2. **Semantic stability （義位不乱）**: do not create homographs that violate **【毎字明意】** or compete with a common character （常用字）.    
3. **Cross-regional legibility （域内可読）**: avoid forms that impede understanding outside Japan.    

Illustrative contrasts: if **區 → 区** and **圖 → 図** are adopted, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> extends comparable component reductions where they do not endanger distinctness.  Conversely, extreme or purely graphic leaps that would break meaning or produce confusion are rejected.  In short, when simplification can be made **consistent, legible, and semantically safe**, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> adopts it; when any of these three are threatened, the traditional form is retained.

## 音訓標
**【[[声形和決]]】**

In <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>, each character （漢字） carries a ruby gloss （振仮名） above it.  The ruby is written in the <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨˇㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚˇ</rt></ruby>).  This shows the intended pronunciation （発音） directly.

### Cardinal 母音
Ruby employs cardinal vowels （基準母音）.  Thus the glyph ·ㄝ represents /e/, unlike in Chinese usage.

### Y Off-Glide （/j/介音）
A horizontal/vertical stroke （縦画） marks the _y_ off-glide.  

### W Off-Glide （/w/介音）
<ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> uses the ㄨ as a final glyph （終声）.


## Extended Bopomofo
<ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> ruby is sufficient for native usage.  However, 注音符号 is capable of rendering Chinese syllables （漢語拼音音節）
- ㄈ is the onset 'f'
- ㄪ is the onset 'v'
- ㄬ is the onset 'ñ'
- ㄓ is the onset 'zh'
- ㄔ is the onset 'ch'
- ㄕ is the onset 'sh'
- ㄖ is the onset 'r'
- ㄗ is the onset 'z'
- ㄘ is the onset 'c'
- ㄙ is Chinese 's'
- ㄭ marks syllabic consonants
- ㄦ is the Chinese rhotic vowel
There are also tone markers: ˉ for tone 1, ˊ for tone 2, ˇ for tone 3, ˋ for tone 4, ˙ for 5.
