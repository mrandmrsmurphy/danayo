> [[単亜語之文法書 Grammar]]
## Historical Background （歴史的背景）

The languages of East Asia （東亜諸語） share a common cultural and linguistic foundation （文化的基盤・言語的基盤）. For many centuries the Civil Service Examination （科挙） defined literacy （識字） and scholarship （学問） throughout the region. It unified intellectual life around the grammar of Middle Chinese （中古漢語文法） and a fixed corpus of classical texts （古典文献）. In this way, the separate structures of four language families — Sino-Tibetan （漢蔵語族）, Japonic （日本語族）, Koreanic （朝鮮語族）, and Austroasiatic （오스트로亜細亜語族） — were set aside, as generations of scholars （学者） assimilated a shared written standard.

Over time, however, this unity declined （統一衰退）. “Chinese” （漢語） diverged into Mandarin （普通話） and other regional vernaculars （方言）. Japan and Korea （日本・韓国） increasingly oriented themselves toward Europe （欧州） rather than Beijing （北京）. In the present day, when Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese （中日韓越, CJKV） delegates meet, they usually conduct discussion in English （英語）. Thus a region once linked by a common grammar （共通文法） now depends upon a foreign lingua franca （外来補助語）, with inevitable losses of nuance and shared heritage.

In Europe, Esperanto （世界語／# 어스퍼란토） has achieved some measure of success as an auxiliary language （補助語）. Its advantages come from three elements: regular grammar （規則的文法）, transparent vocabulary （容易語彙）, and common cultural assumptions （共有文化的前提）. These principles — logic （論理） and shared culture （共有文化） — are also essential for East Asia. In a region where much of the common vocabulary is technical （専門語彙）, the need for systematic devices such as a correlative chart （対応表） is even greater than in Europe.

Educational practices also reveal contrasts. In China （中国）, students are often told that grammar （文法） need only be studied for foreign languages （外国語）, not for Mandarin itself. In Japan （日本）, students spend years bridging the distance between Classical Chinese （漢文）, Old Japanese （上代日本語）, and Modern Japanese （現代日本語）. Korea （韓国／朝鮮）, historically, occupied an intermediate position （中間位置）: geographically, phonetically, and grammatically between China and Japan.

From these observations, the design principles of a unifying language （統一語設計原理） can be derived:

1. **Phonology （音韻）** should favor Old Korean （古代朝鮮語）, which lies between Chinese and Japanese.
    
2. **Orthography （正字法）** should follow Japanese simplification （新字体）, a compromise between Traditional Chinese characters （繁体字） and Simplified Chinese （簡体字）.
    
3. **Grammar （文法）** should continue the framework of Classical Chinese （古典漢語）, which historically served all.
    

Therefore, Dan’a’yo （丹阿語, “the Simple Asian Language” 簡易東亜語） is defined as follows: it adopts Japanese orthographic forms （日本字形）, Korean phonological structure （韓国音声）, and Chinese grammatical principles （中国文法）.

The character base （字彙基盤） follows the intersection of educational standards （教育標準）: Japan’s Jōyō list （常用漢字表, 2136字）, Korea’s secondary-school list （中高校漢字表, 約1800字）, and China’s HSK vocabulary list （漢語水平考試詞彙表）. In addition, official name-character lists （人名用漢字表, 人名用字表） in both Japan and Korea are consulted. Together these define the maximal set （最大集合） of allowable characters.

Words （語） may be as small as a single character （一字）. When necessary, derivation follows rules of logic （論理規則） and commonality （共通性）. Because much shared vocabulary is technical （専門語）, certain fundamental words must be formed analytically （分析的造語）; however, preference is given to pan-Asian, widely recognized terms （汎亜普遍語）. Finally, Japanese compounding practice （日本式複合語）, which shifted to SOV order （主語–目的語–動詞）, is deliberately reversed, restoring the older VO pattern （動詞–目的語）.

## Design Goals （設計目標）

Dan’a’yo （単亜語） is designed as a **universal language** （補助語）. The purpose is not to create a fully naturalistic tongue （自然語, 母語） that could become the first language （第一言語） of an entire region. Rather, it is intended as a **simple tool for communication** （簡易通信工具） between speakers who continue to write poetry （詩歌） and conduct daily life （日常生活） in their own native languages （固有語）.

In this respect, Dan’a’yo is comparable to **Ecclesiastical Latin** （教会羅馬語） in medieval Europe （中世欧州）. Such a language is not only a practical medium, but also a reminder that there is more shared （共有） among the different languages than there is divided （差異）. A common linguistic heritage （共有言語遺産） can bind peoples together （結束）, without becoming a rigid system （硬直制度） or a burden of obsolete rules （旧規則の枷）.

The design principle （設計指標） is straightforward. Any CJKV speaker （中日韓越話者） should be able to look at a text （文章） in Dan’a’yo and visually recognize （視認） or aurally recognize （聴取） more than half of its content. With only a little training （短期学習） or the aid of a simple reference sheet （対照表）, comprehension （理解度） should increase rapidly （急速上昇）.

## Brief Overview
Dan'a'yo sounds somewhat like older Korean.  It is written in Shinjitai Chinese characters, with hangǔl above as the phonological alphabet.  Grammar is somewhere between Classical topic-comment, and modern Japanese/Korean forced into SVO word-order.

In **Dan’a’yo**, expression is shaped by two organizing principles: **three modes of style** and **three meta-parts of speech**.

**Modes.**
1. **Classical / Poetic** — terse, topic–comment, copulas often omitted, written chiefly in kanji.
2. **Literary / Formal** — explicit and conservative, requires copulas and nominalizers where needed, always written with kanji plus ruby.    
3. **Modern / Online** — clipped and context-driven, often omitting particles, written primarily in hangul.

**Meta-parts of speech.**

1. **Content words (実詞)** — nouns, verbs, adjectives; any of these may serve as topic or comment.
2. **Function words (助詞)** — case markers, connectives, pronouns, aspect/degree markers, sentence-final particles.
3. **Special words (特詞)** — numerals, classifiers, determiners, interjections, ideophones; independent but never predicative.
