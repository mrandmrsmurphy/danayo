## Style
The guiding maxim for pragmatics and stylistic breadth in Dan’a’yo is **【[[百家共承]]】** (“All schools jointly inherited”). This motto reflects the language’s deliberate openness: the lexicon and registers of Dan’a’yo are drawn from the full range of East Asian tradition and modernity alike.

Two principles flow from this maxim:

1. **詞彙兼容** — lexical inclusivity, welcoming terms from every school of thought and every cultural source.    
2. **文体並存** — stylistic coexistence, allowing classical elegance, formal clarity, and modern brevity to share one framework.    

Thus **【百家共承】** makes explicit the pragmatic philosophy of Dan’a’yo: not to limit itself to one lineage, but to acknowledge and inherit them all in common.

## Translation
The guiding maxim for translation and loanword practice in Dan’a’yo is **【[[義重於音]]】** (“Meaning outweighs sound”). This motto rejects the fragile practice of phonetic transcription, which varies across regions and shifts over time, in favor of semantic clarity.

Two principles flow from this maxim:
1. **義以立名** — names should be established by meaning, conveying identity or quality that endures across languages.    
2. **音不為主** — sound alone must not govern transcription, since pronunciations differ between communities and change with history.    

Thus **【義重於音】** enshrines the translation policy of Dan’a’yo: **semantic transparency ensures stability and mutual comprehension**, whereas phonetic imitation risks confusion and obsolescence.
