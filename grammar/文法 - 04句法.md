> The guiding maxim for <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> syntax is **【<ruby>[[文言現代]]<rt>ㄇㄨㄋㄝㄋㄏㄧㄝㄋㄉㄚㄧ</rt></ruby>】** (“Classical and Contemporary”). This motto highlights the dual inheritance （二重伝統） of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>: the **paratactic structure of Classical Chinese** （文言句法, Classical syntax） and the **SVO grammar of modern East Asian languages** （現代語文法, 主語–動詞–目的語構造）.

>The motto emphasizes two principles:

>1. **Continuity with the classical written standard** （[[文言承継]]） — preserving topic–comment structure （主題–述部構造） and concision （簡潔性）.    
>2. **Adaptation to modern speech** （[[現代適応]]） — requiring verbs in every clause （述語必須） and maintaining subject–verb–object order （SVO語順）.    
>
>Thus **【<ruby>[[文言現代]]<rt>ㄇㄨㄋㄝㄋㄏㄧㄝㄋㄉㄚㄧ</rt></ruby>】** expresses the balance （均衡） that defines <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>句法: rooted in the authority of the classical tradition, yet usable in the context of modern communication.

# 構文論

## **句法之式**
単亜語 has significantly different grammars for its three different modes of usage.  They roughly correspond to poetry, online, and norma.

### 古雅体
**【[[先題後述]]】**

古雅体 is the most concise and elevated mode of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>. It deliberately echoes the terseness of Classical Chinese, omitting copulas and particles whenever possible and favoring compact topic–comment phrasing. In this mode, composition often employs **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> only**, without ruby, in imitation of the ancient standard. Such writing is especially suited to **poetry and aphorism**, where brevity and resonance are prized.

At the same time, 古雅体 admits a second face: the **訓読古雅** mode. Here, <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> functions as a _kanbun-style overlay_ upon authentic Classical Chinese texts. The base text remains in its original literary form, while ruby provides syntactic guidance, recasting the clauses into <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> grammar. (Apparati exist to decorate CC text in ways that allow emendation of additional characters, modified word-order, and phonetic transcription.) This dual function allows 古雅体 both to **generate new compositions in a venerable style** and to **interpret the classical canon within a modern IAL framework**.

Thus 古雅体 is not merely an archaizing affectation, but a **living bridge**: it connects <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> to the deep textual heritage of the Sinosphere while enabling its speakers to engage directly with those texts.

### 網語体

網語体 is the **fastest and most economical mode** of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>. It reflects the realities of digital communication, where technical constraints or platform norms may restrict writing to **<ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> only** (most common) or, more rarely, to **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> only**.

In this mode, **subject–verb–object order dominates**. The older topic–comment structure is rarely used, since clarity depends on the immediacy of SVO sequencing. **Grammatical particles**—case markers, connectives, and even copulas—are dropped wherever context makes their function obvious. The result is a clipped, elliptical style that maximizes **speed of input** and **ease of recognition** on small screens.

網語体 also pushes **pro-drop to the limit**: pronouns, topics, and even objects are omitted whenever recoverable from context. A single verb or adjective can carry an entire utterance, especially in fast back-and-forth exchanges.

Thus 網語体 is not careless but **context-driven**, relying on shared knowledge and situational cues. It represents <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> as it lives in the immediacy of modern communication—**stripped, agile, and efficient**.

### 書面体

>[!tip]
>The guiding maxim for the orthography of 書面体 is **【[[文音共決]]】** (“Script and sound resolved together”). This motto affirms that **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> must appear together** in Literary mode: the written form (文) provides semantic precision, while the phonetic gloss (音) guarantees accessibility.
>
> Two principles flow from this maxim:
>
>1. **文以定義** — script clarifies meaning, preserving the depth and authority of the Han tradition.    
>2. **音以達読** — sound ensures readability, allowing all learners to pronounce and understand without ambiguity.    
>
>Thus **【文音共決】** enshrines the policy of dual orthography in Literary <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>: **neither <ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> nor ruby stands alone**, but both together secure the clarity and reach of the language.

書面体 is the **standard and authoritative mode** of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>, designed for clarity, precision, and mutual intelligibility across the CJKV sphere. Where 古雅体 is compact and 網語体 is clipped, 書面体 is **fully explicit**. It preserves the elegance of the classical tradition while adapting it to the expectations of modern grammar.

Key features include:

1. **Copular constructions.** When both topic and comment are **名詞**, a copula (是/非) is required. E.g. <ruby>我<rt>ㄚ</rt></ruby> <ruby>是魚<rt>ㄙㄝㄧㄛ</rt></ruby>。 “I am a fish.”
2. **Nominalization.** When **評詞 (verbs)** or **性詞 (statives)** serve as topics, they must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物. E.g. _保持事 平常_ “Maintaining is common.”
3. **Verbal completeness.** 評詞 are considered **incomplete without an object**; a transitive verb must show its argument. Ellipsis is far less tolerated here than in other modes.
4. **TAM marking.** Tense–aspect–mood suffixes such as -已 (perfective), -中 (progressive), and -将 (prospective) are not optional; they are **highly encouraged** and regularly employed.
5. **Adnominals.** Modifiers must attach with **之**, preserving the classical written convention. E.g. _走之馬_ “great person.”
6. **Case-marking.** Postpositions are required. Omitting 于, 於, 由, etc., is considered ungrammatical in this mode.
7. **Sentence-final particles.** All non-declarative sentences must end with a **sentence-final particle** (乎, 矣, 哉, etc.) to mark interrogation, exclamation, or modality.
8. **Adverbial placement.** Adverbs and adverbial phrases are typically placed **immediately before the verb**, in canonical East Asian fashion.
9. **Orthography.** Both **<ruby>漢字<rt>ㄏㄚㄋㄐㄧ</rt></ruby> and <ruby>注音符号<rt>ㄐㄨㄨㄇㄅㄨㄏㄚㄨ</rt></ruby> ruby** are required whenever possible. This dual representation ensures accessibility and disambiguation across audiences.
10. **Determiners.** Names, technical terms, and obscure words must be followed by a **限定詞** in written texts to mark them clearly (阿, 鳥, 虫, 服, etc.).


In sum, 書面体 embodies **grammatical conservatism and explicitness**. It is the mode for scholarship, formal correspondence, and inter-CJKV communication. Where 古雅体 preserves concision and 網語体 embraces speed, 書面体 provides the **normative baseline**: the form every learner must master, and the register in which <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> most fully expresses its dual inheritance.

## 語類之大別
The grammar of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby> organizes all words into **three great classes** (_meta–parts of speech_). Each class has its own internal subcategories, which are treated in turn.

### 実詞
Content words are the **core vocabulary of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>**. They name entities, describe states, and express events. Unlike 助詞 or <ruby>特詞<rt>ㄉㄨㄎㄙㄚ</rt></ruby>, any <ruby>実詞<rt>ㄙㄧㄊㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> can serve as either **topic** or **comment** in a clause. Four major subtypes are recognized: 名詞, 評詞, 性詞, and 繋詞.

#### 名詞
<ruby>[[名詞]]<rt>ㄇㄧㄥㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> refer to persons, things, and concepts (_神, 人, 母親_).

- In **書面体 (Literary mode)**, a noun cannot serve as the **comment** by itself when paired with another noun; it requires a **copula**.    
    - _我 是魚_ — “I am a fish.”        
- Otherwise, nouns may freely serve as **topics** without further marking.

#### 事詞
Eventives are **transitive verbs** (_創造, 捕, 行_), denoting actions or processes.

- A 事詞 requires **both subject and object**. It is incomplete without its complement.    
    - _神 創造 世界_ — “God created the world.”        
- When an object is absent, a **passive prefix** (_被_) may license the form:    
    - _世界 被創造_ — “The world was created.”        
- As modifiers, 事詞 must attach to nouns with **之**:    
    - _走之馬_ — “the running horse.”        
- As **comment**, 事詞 are expected and natural.    
- To serve as **topic**, 事詞 must be **nominalized** with -事 or -物:    
    - _創造事 艱難_ — “Creation is difficult.”

#### 性詞
Statives are **qualities or intransitives** (_白, 大, 暴怒_). They bridge the categories of adjective and verb.

- Like adjectives, 性詞 may **modify nouns directly** without 之:    
    - _大人_ — “great person.”        
- Like verbs, they may serve as **comment** without a copula:    
    - _天 高_ — “The sky is high.”        
- To serve as **topic**, statives require the suffix -物:    
    - _高物 難測_ — “Height is difficult to measure.”

#### 繋詞
繋詞 form a small but crucial class that overlaps noun, verb, and function.

- **Transitive copulas**: 是, 非, 有, 無.    
    - They take an explicit complement (_我 是魚_; _此 非道_).        
- **Intransitive copulas**: 在, 莫.    
    - They indicate existence or location (_人在於地_), or negation (_莫能為_).        
- Because of their hybrid function, 繋詞 are classified under <ruby>実詞<rt>ㄙㄧㄊㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> but behave like **grammatical pivots** in syntax.

### 助詞
Function words are the **grammatical operators** of <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>. They cannot themselves serve as **topic** or **comment**, but they bind, modify, or frame the <ruby>実詞<rt>ㄙㄧㄊㄙㄚ</rt></ruby>. Most are short, frequent, and either suffixing or prefixing depending on type.

#### 関詞
<ruby>関詞<rt>ㄍˇㄚㄇㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> are modeled on Japanese and Korean postpositions. They attach after nouns or noun phrases to mark their **syntactic role**.

- Almost all <ruby>関詞<rt>ㄍˇㄚㄇㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> are **suffixing**.    
- Examples:    
    - **于** — dative / locative (_父于_ “to dad”)        
    - **哉** — vocative (_父哉!_ “O Father!”)        
    - **丈** — restrictive “only” (_一人丈_ “only one person”)        
    - **且** — additive “also” (_我且行_ “I also go”)        
    - **就** — delimitative “just, precisely” (_此就道_ “this is just the way”)        

#### 修飾語
修飾語 include **prefixing particles** that alter, restrict, or frame the meaning of content words. They can express deixis, negation, potentiality, or degree.

- Most 修飾語 are **prefixes**.    
- Examples:    
    - **不** — negation (_不行_ “not go”)        
    - **可** — potential (_可行_ “can go”)        
    - **已** — perfective (_已行_ “has gone”)        
    - **未** — negative perfective (_未行_ “has not gone yet”)        
    - **此 / 其 / 彼** — proximal, medial, distal deixis.        

#### 代詞
代詞 stand in for other nouns or noun phrases, and include persons, demonstratives, and correlatives. They are not inflected but follow a regular correlative system.

- Examples:    
    - **我** — first person singular.        
    - **君** — second person singular.       
    - **誰** — interrogative “who.”        
    - **何** — interrogative “what.”        
    - **此, 其, 彼** — demonstratives (also used deictically as 修飾語).        

#### 語気助詞
語気助詞 here are distinct from the copular <ruby>実詞<rt>ㄙㄧㄊㄙㄚ</rt></ruby>. They occur at the end of a clause and mark **mood, modality, or emotion**.

- Examples:    
    - **[[乎 (char)]]** — interrogative particle (_汝行乎?_ “Do you go?”)        
    - **[[矣]]** — emphatic (_已行矣_ “Why has he gone?!")        
    - **[[哉]]** — negative alarm (also vocative)
    - **[[也]]** - exclamative
    - **[[哇]]** - wow
    - **[[該]]** – should, ought
    - **[[別]]** – do not
    - **[[勿]]** – do not ever
    - **[[夫]]** – right?, isn't it?
    - **[[請]]** – please
    - **[[就]]** – let
    - **[[了]]** – done, over, copy
    - **[[似 (char)]]** – it's as if ...

#### 連接詞
[[接詞]] link clauses, phrases, or even whole texts. They are frequent and indispensable in extended discourse.

- Examples:    
    - **而** — coordinating “and, but.”        
    - **乃** — consequential “therefore, then.”        
    - **雖** — concessive “although.”        
    - **若** — conditional “if.”

### 特詞
<ruby>特詞<rt>ㄉㄨㄎㄙㄚ</rt></ruby> are **independent forms** that play crucial roles in counting, classification, determination, and emotive expression, yet they are **never predicative**. Unlike <ruby>実詞<rt>ㄙㄧㄊㄙㄚ</rt></ruby>, they cannot serve directly as topic or comment, and unlike 助詞, they do not operate on syntax. Instead, they stand apart as **auxiliary but indispensable elements** of discourse.

#### 数詞 
Numerals express number and order (_一, 二十, 三百_). They combine productively with 量詞 to form counting phrases.
- **Cardinals:** 一, 二, 三…
- **Tens, hundreds, thousands:** 十, 百, 千…    
- **Ordinals:** formed with 第 (_第一_ “first”).    

#### 量詞
 In <ruby>単亜語<rt>ㄉㄚㄋ·ㄚ·˙ㄛ</rt></ruby>, number is not usually specified. A bare noun phrase (NP) may refer to one or more items depending on context. When **explicit numerals** are required, they follow the NP, and must themselves be followed (without a space) by a **量詞**, which categorizes the NP in order to express number.

> **Rule:**  
> NP + Numeral + Classifier

Classifiers are a set of twelve words (see table below) which group nouns into semantic categories (people, animals, machines, books, etc.). A noun phrase with classifier is always **definite**.

Examples
1. **有 犬三匹。**    
    - **Gloss:** have dog three-ANIMAL        
    - **Meaning:** “(I) have three dogs.”        
2. **肋骨六条 与 歯五個 被砕已。**    
    - **Gloss:** rib six-LONG + tooth five-MISC passive-break already        
    - **Meaning:** “Six ribs and five teeth were broken.”

- In spoken style, the numeral + classifier is tightly bound, without pause.    
- Different classifiers reflect the shape, animacy, or function of the noun:    
    - **匹** (animals), **条** (long-thin), **冊** (books), **台** (machines), **杯** (cupfuls), etc.        
- The “miscellaneous” classifier **個** may be used when the category is unclear.

| Character | Class          | Examples                                |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 人        | people        | any person without reference to status   |
| 名        | people (name) | deferential term for person              |
| 台        | machines      | computers, cars, blenders, nanobots      |
| 匹        | animals       | cat, elephants, mice, platypuses         |
| 冊        | books         | books, magazines, newspapers, ezines     |
| 杯        | cupfuls       | glass of water, shots of alcohol         |

| 条        | long, thin    | pencils, noodles, fingers                |
| 段        | time intervals| seconds, days, years                     |
| 番        | times         | turns, happenings, repeats               |
| 束        | bundles       | groups, bouquets, bales                  |
| 個        | misc.         | anything else                            |
   

#### 限定詞
Determiners clarify **semantic domains** of nouns, especially proper names, rare words, and ambiguous references. They are required in **書面体** after names and technical terms.

- Examples:    
    - **阿** — personal names         
    - **鳥** — birds         
    - **虫** — insects         
    - **服** — clothing         

#### 感詞
Emotive particles that stand alone as full utterances, expressing feeling or reaction.

- Examples: **哎**, **唉**, **嗚**, **ㄛㄛ**, **ㄚㄚ**.    

#### 擬詞
Express sound, manner, or sensory vividness, often reduplicated or stylized.

- Examples:    
    - **嘩** — a crash.        
    - **軣軣** — roaring.        
    - **滴滴** — dripping.        
    - **きらきら**, **반짝반짝** — sparkling.
