## Definition and Etymology

天地, composed of 天 ("heaven" or "sky") and 地 ("earth" or "ground"), is a foundational concept in cosmology and philosophy. While literally meaning "heaven and earth," the term functions as a technical expression denoting the cosmos, the natural world, or the totality of manifest existence.

### Cosmological Significance

In cosmological thought, 天地 represents the basic structure of the universe as a complementary dyad. Heaven (天) and Earth (地) are not merely physical locations but cosmic principles:

- **天 (Heaven)**: Associated with yang (陽), the celestial, the light, the active principle, creativity, and what is above
- **地 (Earth)**: Associated with yin (陰), the terrestrial, the receptive, what is heavy/solid, and what is below

Together, 天地 encompasses all of manifest reality - "the ten thousand things" ([[万物]]) exist between and are generated by the interaction of Heaven and Earth.

### Philosophical Contexts

**In Confucianism**: 天地 represents the natural order and moral framework. The _Yijing_ ([[易經]], _Book of Changes_) states that Heaven and Earth determine position (天地定位), establishing the fundamental structure of reality. Humans occupy a mediating position between Heaven and Earth, forming a triad ([[天地人]]).

**In Daoism**: The _Daodejing_ (道德經) presents Heaven and Earth as arising from the Dao and operating according to spontaneous natural patterns. Chapter 5 famously states that "Heaven and Earth are not humane" (天地不仁), meaning they operate according to natural principles without anthropocentric moral preferences. In cosmogonic sequences like those in the _Liezi_, 天地 emerge from the earlier primordial stages ([[太易]], [[太初]], [[太始]], [[太素]]) through the separation of the clear/light (rising to become Heaven) and the turbid/heavy (descending to become Earth).

**In Correlative Cosmology**: Heaven and Earth form the foundational pair in the elaborate systems of correspondence developed during the Han Dynasty, relating to the Five Phases ([[五行]]), directions, seasons, and all aspects of natural and human affairs.

### The Separation of Heaven and Earth

A crucial mythological and cosmological theme is the separation or opening of Heaven and Earth (開天闢地). In the primordial state of [[渾沌]] ("chaos" or "undifferentiated unity"), Heaven and Earth were mixed together. Their separation marks the beginning of the ordered cosmos. This appears in texts like the _Huainanzi_ and is elaborated in later mythology (such as the Pangu [[盤古]] creation myth).

### Linguistic Usage

Beyond its technical cosmological meaning, 天地 is used idiomatically to mean:

- The world or universe in general
- Nature and natural phenomena
- A vast difference (as in 天地之別, "difference between heaven and earth")

## Related Concepts

天地 should be understood in relation to: [[陰陽]] (the complementary cosmic forces), [[乾坤]] (qiánkūn, Heaven and Earth as represented in the _Yijing_ hexagrams), and 万物 ("the ten thousand things" - all phenomena that exist between Heaven and Earth).
