## Definition and Etymology

太始, composed of 太 ("great" or "supreme") and 始 ("beginning" or "start"), is a fundamental cosmological concept in philosophy, particularly within Daoism and Huang-Lao thought. The term literally translates as "Great Beginning" or "Grand Commencement."

### Philosophical Context

In Daoist cosmogony, 太始 represents one of the primordial stages in the unfolding of the cosmos from the Dao. It appears in various cosmological schemes that attempt to describe the process by which the undifferentiated unity of the Dao gives rise to the manifest universe.

The earliest systematic treatment appears in the _Liezi_ (列子), specifically in the _Tianrui_ chapter (天瑞篇), where 太始 is positioned within a four-stage sequence of primordial development:

- 太易 - "Great Change" or "Great Simplicity" - before qi (breath/energy) appears
- 太初 - "Great Beginning" - the beginning of qi
- 太始 - "Great Commencement" - the beginning of form (形, _xíng_)
- 太素 - "Great Plainness" - the beginning of substance/matter (質, _zhì_)

In this schema from the _Liezi_, 太始 represents the stage at which form first emerges, though matter/substance has not yet appeared. It marks the crucial transition from complete formlessness toward the materialization of the cosmos.

However, the _Huainanzi_ (淮南子) _Tianwen_ chapter (天文篇) presents a notably different interpretation, defining 太始 as the primordial state _before_ heaven and earth had form - a stage that would precede even the _Liezi_'s four-fold sequence. This demonstrates that 太始 was understood differently across various cosmological traditions.

### Historical Development

The concept gained prominence during the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as cosmological speculation intensified. It was incorporated into correlative cosmology and became part of systematic attempts to map the stages of cosmic development.

In later Daoist religious tradition, the _Liezi_'s four stages (太易, 太初, 太始, 太素) were combined with 太極 ("Great Ultimate") to form the "Five Primordial Tai" (先天五太), a foundational cosmological framework.

### Historical Usage as Era Name

Beyond its philosophical significance, 太始 was also adopted as an era name (年號) by Chinese rulers. Emperor Wu of Han (漢武帝, Liu Che/劉徹) was the first to use 太始 as a reign title, and it was subsequently employed multiple times throughout history.

## Related Concepts

太始 should be distinguished from related terms like 太初 (occurring earlier in the _Liezi_ cosmological sequence) and connects to broader discussions of 無 ("nonbeing") and 有 ("being") in metaphysics.
