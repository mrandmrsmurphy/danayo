## Notes
### Definition
自己 denotes the reflexive self. It refers back to the grammatical subject of a clause and marks that the actor and the affected party are the same.

### Function
It operates primarily at the syntactic level. It answers the question: who performs or receives the action? It does not inherently express philosophical identity or intrinsic essence.

### Usage Principle
Use 自己 when indicating reflexive action or self-reference within discourse. Do not use it for abstract discussions of identity, ego, or intrinsic nature. Not [[自身]], nor [[自我]]
