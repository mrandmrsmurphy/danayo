## Notes
### Definition
自身 denotes the intrinsic or emphatic self. It refers to a person or thing in and of itself, highlighting internal condition or inherent property.

### Function
It operates at the ontic level. It answers the question: what is the thing itself, apart from external relation? It may apply to persons, institutions, or abstract entities.

### Usage Principle
Use 自身 for emphasis or when focusing on the inherent state, responsibility, or condition of an entity. Do not use it merely as a reflexive pronoun.  Not [[自己]], nor [[自我]]
