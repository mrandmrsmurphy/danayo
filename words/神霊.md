## Definition and Etymology
神靈, composed of 神 ("spirit," "deity," or "divine") and 靈 ("numen," "spirit," or "efficacious"), denotes spiritual beings, divine powers, numinous forces, or the spiritual aspect of reality. The term encompasses a wide semantic range from specific supernatural entities to general spiritual presence or divine efficacy.

### Basic Meanings and Usage
神靈 functions across several related registers:

- Spirits, deities, or supernatural beings (often plural or collective)
- Divine power, numinous presence, or spiritual efficacy
- The spiritual dimension or aspect of things
- Efficacious or miraculous power attributed to divine sources
- Sacred or numinous quality

Unlike terms that denote a single, specific deity, 神靈 typically refers to spiritual beings generally or to the quality of spiritual presence itself.

### Cosmological Significance

**Divine Agency in Creation**: In cosmogonic contexts, 神靈 can describe the divine power or numinous presence active in the formation and ordering of the cosmos. This usage appears in accounts where spiritual force or divine agency operates upon primordial matter - as in the image of divine spirit moving over primordial waters or infusing the undifferentiated chaos with creative power.

This cosmological sense does not necessarily specify a single deity but rather acknowledges spiritual or divine causation in the emergence of the ordered world from formlessness. The 神靈 in such contexts represents:

- Active divine presence in primordial states
- The spiritual power that transforms chaos into cosmos
- Numinous agency that transcends mere material process
- The bridge between ultimate transcendence and manifest creation

**Relationship to Primordial States**: In some cosmological frameworks, 神靈 describes the spiritual aspect present even in or before states like 混沌 (primordial chaos) or 太始 (great beginning). This suggests that spiritual reality or divine presence precedes or accompanies material emergence, giving cosmogony a theistic or spiritualist dimension rather than purely materialist or naturalistic character.

### Traditional Chinese Religious Context

**Plurality of Spirits**: In traditional religion, 神靈 most commonly refers to the multitude of spirits and deities that inhabit the cosmos:

- Nature spirits (山神, 水神 - mountain and water spirits)
- Ancestor spirits (祖先神靈 - ancestral spirits)
- Deified heroes and historical figures
- Local protective deities (土地神, 城隍 - earth gods, city gods)
- Celestial bureaucracy of Daoist pantheon
- Buddhist bodhisattvas and protective deities

This plural conception reflects a worldview where spiritual beings are numerous, hierarchically organized, and functionally specific - different 神靈 govern different domains, locations, and human concerns.

### Animistic Dimensions
神靈 carries animistic associations, suggesting that spiritual presence or numinous power can:

- Inhabit natural features (mountains, rivers, trees, stones)
- Reside in specific locations (temples, shrines, sacred groves)
- Manifest through particular objects (divine images, ritual implements)
- Be concentrated in certain times (festivals, auspicious moments)

This animistic understanding sees the world as spiritually alive - not merely matter in motion but matter infused with or inhabited by spiritual presence. The 靈 component particularly emphasizes this efficacious, active quality of spiritual beings - they are not abstract concepts but responsive, powerful presences.

### Spiritual Aspect of Reality
Beyond discrete entities, 神靈 can denote the spiritual dimension of reality itself:

- The numinous quality that makes something sacred
- The efficacious power that enables divine response to prayers or rituals
- The spiritual essence as opposed to physical form
- The realm of the sacred as distinct from the profane

In this usage, 神靈 points to a fundamental ontological distinction - the spiritual order exists alongside or within the material order, and spiritual causation operates according to different principles than physical causation.

### Philosophical and Religious Variations

**Confucian Perspective**: Classical Confucianism maintains a respectful but somewhat agnostic stance toward 神靈. The _Analects_ records Confucius saying "respect ghosts and spirits but keep them at a distance" (敬鬼神而遠之). Confucian ritual practice acknowledges 神靈 (especially ancestors) while emphasizing human ethical relationships over supernatural concerns. Later Neo-Confucianism often reinterpreted 神靈 in terms of 理 (principle) and 氣 (vital energy), naturalizing what folk religion understood supernaturally.

**Daoist Context**: Daoism developed elaborate hierarchies of 神靈, from the highest celestial deities (三清, "Three Pure Ones") through administrative bureaucracies to local spirits. The Daoist cosmos is densely populated with spiritual beings, and Daoist practice involves communication, propitiation, and alignment with these 神靈. At the same time, philosophical Daoism emphasizes that all 神靈 ultimately derive from and return to the Dao - spiritual beings are manifestations of ultimate reality rather than independent entities.

**Buddhist Adaptation**: <ruby>佛教<rt>ㄅㄨㄊㄍ˙ㄚˇ</rt></ruby>, entering China, encountered and partially absorbed the language of 神靈. Buddhist texts speak of protective 神靈 (護法神) who guard the dharma, though Buddhist philosophy ultimately regards even gods and spirits as caught within samsara - superior to humans in power but not liberated from suffering and rebirth. The Buddha himself transcends the category of 神靈, being awakened rather than merely divine.

**Folk Religion**: In folk religious practice, 神靈 are immediate, practical realities - beings who respond to offerings, answer prayers, provide protection, and demand respect. The relationship between humans and 神靈 is often transactional: proper ritual behavior and offerings elicit divine favor and efficacy. This pragmatic approach focuses less on theological speculation than on maintaining proper relationships with the spiritual realm.

### Monotheistic and Deistic Interpretations
While 神靈 typically suggests plurality, the term can accommodate monotheistic or deistic frameworks when understood as:

- The divine spirit (singular) as opposed to multiple spirits
- The spiritual presence or power of a single God
- The numinous aspect of ultimate reality
- Divine agency acting in or upon creation

In such interpretations, 神靈 describes not a category of beings but the spiritual nature or active presence of the one ultimate reality. This usage requires contextual clarity - modifiers, singular grammatical treatment, or theological framing that distinguishes "the divine Spirit" from "spirits plural."

This flexibility allows 神靈 to function in cosmological or theological contexts that affirm spiritual agency in creation without necessarily committing to polytheism. The term can describe divine presence operating in primordial or creative processes while remaining neutral about whether this presence is singular or multiple, personal or impersonal, transcendent deity or immanent force.

### Spiritual Efficacy and Response
A crucial dimension of 神靈 is 靈驗 (língyàn, "spiritual efficacy" or "responsiveness"). 神靈 are not merely postulated abstractions but efficacious presences - they respond to human action, manifest in experience, and demonstrate power. This emphasis on efficacy means:

- Prayers to 神靈 can be answered
- Rituals directed toward 神靈 produce results
- 神靈 can manifest through signs, possessions, or miracles
- The reality of 神靈 is verified through experience rather than abstract argument

## Usage Across CJKV Languages
**Japanese (しんれい / 神霊, _shinrei_)**: Japanese usage parallels Chinese, referring to spirits, deities, and divine presence. Shinto's 神 (kami) concept overlaps significantly with 神靈 - the numerous spirits inhabiting nature, ancestors, and sacred places. 神霊 appears in both Shinto and Buddhist contexts, as well as in general discussion of spiritual phenomena.

**Korean (신령, _sillyeong_ or _sinryeong_)**: Korean preserves both shamanic and Buddhist/Confucian associations. 신령 can refer to mountain spirits, ancestor spirits, guardian deities, and the general category of supernatural beings. Korean shamanism (무속, _musok_) involves mediation with various 신령 who possess power over different life domains.  Like Japanese, the term greatly overlaps with 신 or 귀신 (鬼神).

**Vietnamese (_thần linh_)**: Vietnamese _thần linh_ describes spirits in traditional Vietnamese religion, ancestor worship, and Buddhist practice. The term encompasses both benevolent protective spirits and potentially dangerous supernatural beings requiring proper propitiation. Vietnamese popular religion recognizes numerous _thần linh_ associated with natural features, villages, and ancestors.
