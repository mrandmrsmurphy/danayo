There is a similar division to Asia as exists in the West, between terms like 'soccer' and 'football'. J/K use 蹴球 (lt. kick ball) while C uses 'foot ball'/足球. All these terms should be considered as ambiguous as English "football" in an international context, and should probably be followed by sakka or putbolü.
