## Definition and Etymology
空虛, composed of 空 ("empty" or "void") and 虛 ("empty," "vacant," or "unreal"), is a compound term denoting emptiness, void, vacuousness, or insubstantiality. While both characters individually carry deep philosophical significance in Far East Asian thought, their usage as a fixed compound appears to be more characteristic of later periods than of the earliest classical texts.

## Individual Character Significance
**空**: This character is central to Buddhist philosophy, where it translates the Sanskrit _śūnyatā_ (emptiness). In Buddhist metaphysics, 空 refers to the fundamental lack of inherent, independent existence in all phenomena. The Heart Sutra's famous declaration "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (色即是空，空即是色) exemplifies this usage. In Buddhist contexts, 空 is not mere nothingness but rather the absence of fixed, permanent essence - a concept crucial to understanding dependent origination and non-self.

**虛**: This character appears prominently in Daoist texts, particularly the _Daodejing_ and _Zhuangzi_. The _Daodejing_ emphasizes 虛 as creative emptiness or receptive vacancy - the empty space that makes things functional (as in the hollow of a vessel or the hub of a wheel). Chapter 5 of the _Daodejing_ speaks of the space between Heaven and Earth as being like a bellows: "empty yet inexhaustible" (虛而不屈). In Daoist thought, 虛 represents the state of openness, receptivity, and potential that allows for spontaneous transformation.

## The Compound 空虛
As a compound, 空虛 combines these resonances of emptiness and void. However, the precise dating and classical usage of 空虛 as a fixed term requires caution. In classical Daoist and Buddhist texts, 空 and 虛 more commonly appear as separate concepts rather than as a bound compound. The compound appears to have gained currency in later periods, potentially during the convergence of Buddhist and Daoist thought in the medieval period.

### Philosophical Dimensions
When used philosophically, 空虛 can denote:

- **Ontological emptiness**: The lack of substantial, independent reality
- **Creative void**: The fertile emptiness from which things arise
- **Mental emptiness**: A state of mind free from attachments, preconceptions, or disturbances
- **Spatial void**: Physical or conceptual empty space

The term bridges Buddhist and Daoist conceptions of emptiness, though these traditions understand emptiness somewhat differently. Buddhism emphasizes the lack of inherent existence (_svabhāva_), while Daoism emphasizes the productive potential of emptiness and non-being.

## Modern Usage
In modern Chinese, 空虛 commonly means "empty," "hollow," "void," or psychologically "feeling empty" or "lacking substance." This everyday usage has largely lost the profound philosophical implications of the classical traditions. The term often describes:

- A feeling of meaninglessness or purposelessness
- Lack of substantial content
- Psychological emptiness or loneliness

This shift from ontological/spiritual emptiness to psychological emptiness represents a significant secularization of the term.

### Usage Across CJKV Languages
**Japanese (くうきょ/空虚, _kūkyo_)**: Maintains both philosophical and common meanings, though the philosophical usage is primarily in Buddhist or scholarly contexts discussing Chinese philosophy. In everyday Japanese, it typically means "emptiness," "vanity," or "hollowness" in a psychological or evaluative sense.

**Korean (공허, _gongheo_)**: Similar to Japanese, preserves the term in both philosophical contexts (particularly in discussions of Buddhism) and everyday usage meaning "empty," "hollow," or psychologically "void."

**Vietnamese (_không hư_)**: The term exists but is less commonly used than in Japanese or Korean. Vietnamese tends to use the individual characters separately in philosophical contexts, while the compound may appear in literary or formal usage.

## Related Concepts
空虛 relates to: 無 ("nonbeing" or "nothingness"), 虛無 ("emptiness and nothingness"), 空性 (_śūnyatā_, "emptiness" in Buddhist sense), and 真空 ("true emptiness" in Buddhist philosophy).
