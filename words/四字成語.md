# 四字成語

## Literal meaning
“Four-character fixed expressions.”

## Extended or idiomatic sense
A metalinguistic term referring to the culturally marked status of four-character expressions within the CJKV literary sphere. Once a phrase stabilizes at four characters, it is implicitly framed as rhythmically balanced, semantically dense, and culturally resonant. While many four-character sequences are ordinary compounds, 四字成語 names the expectation that such forms carry elevated significance, intertextual depth, or aphoristic weight beyond their surface meaning.

## Pronunciations
- **Mandarin:** sì zì chéng yǔ
- **Cantonese:** sei3 zi6 sing4 jyu5
- **Japanese (on-yomi):** しじせいご
- **Korean (Sino-Korean):** 사자성어 (sa-ja seong-eo)
- **Vietnamese (Sino-Vietnamese):** tứ tự thành ngữ

## Notes on scope and tone
四字成語 is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It names a shared cultural intuition: four-character length functions as a threshold at which rhythm, memorability, and literary seriousness coalesce. The term applies across Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese traditions, even where modern usage or script differs. In manifesto or design discourse, it can be used to explain why four-character formulations are favored for principles, slogans, and philosophical condensation, without claiming that all such forms are archaic or formulaic.
