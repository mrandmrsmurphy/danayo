## Definition and Etymology
黒暗, composed of 黒("black") and 暗 ("dark" or "dim"), denotes darkness, the absence of light, or obscurity. While literally referring to the physical quality of darkness, the term carries significant cosmological and moral-spiritual dimensions in philosophical and religious thought.

## Physical and Descriptive Meaning

At its most basic level, 黒暗 describes:

- The absence or lack of light
- The color quality of blackness or deep darkness
- Dim, shadowy, or obscure conditions
- Nighttime or un-illuminated spaces

This physical darkness contrasts with [[光明]] ("light" or "brightness") and relates to the broader category of dark colors and shaded conditions.

### Cosmological Significance

In cosmological thought, darkness carries associations with the primordial state and fundamental cosmic principles:

**Connection to 玄**: The _Daodejing_ uses 玄 ("dark," "mysterious," "profound") to describe the Dao itself: "mysterious and again mysterious, the gateway of all wonders" (玄之又玄，眾妙之門). This primordial darkness is not mere absence but profound depth - the dark, undifferentiated state from which all things emerge.

**Yin Principle**: Darkness aligns with yin (陰), the receptive, hidden, interior, and earthly principle in the yinyang dyad. Just as Earth is associated with yin and heaviness that settles below, darkness belongs to the yin aspect of reality - the concealed, the interior, the potential.

**Primordial Obscurity**: In cosmogonic accounts, the state before the separation of Heaven and Earth (天地) is sometimes characterized by darkness or obscurity - the undifferentiated 混沌 before the clear/light rises and the turbid/heavy descends. Darkness thus represents not just absence but primordial potentiality.

### Moral and Spiritual Dimensions

Beyond its cosmological neutrality or profundity, 黒暗 also carries moral and spiritual valences, particularly in soteriological contexts:

**Buddhist Usage - Ignorance and Delusion**: In Buddhist thought, darkness often symbolizes [[無明]] (_avidyā_, "ignorance" or "not-knowing"), the fundamental ignorance of reality's true nature that binds beings in suffering. The Buddha's enlightenment is described as bringing light into darkness, dispelling the obscuration that prevents beings from seeing things as they truly are (空, empty of inherent existence). Darkness here represents spiritual blindness or the unenlightened state.

**Moral Obscurity**: In ethical contexts across traditions, 黒暗 can denote:

- Moral corruption or evil ("dark times," "dark deeds")
- Hidden wrongdoing or secrecy with negative intent
- Oppression or absence of justice (暗無天日, "so dark the sun cannot be seen")
- Confusion or lack of clarity in judgment

**Contrast with Light**: The 光明/黒暗 (light/darkness) polarity functions as a moral and epistemological metaphor - enlightenment versus ignorance, clarity versus confusion, good governance versus tyranny, transparency versus secrecy.

**Daoist Ambiguity**: It's worth noting that Daoist thought maintains a more ambiguous relationship with darkness than Buddhist or Confucian moral frameworks. The 玄 (profound darkness) of the Dao is positive - it represents depth, mystery, and the generative unknown rather than ignorance or evil. The valley spirit (谷神) is dark and receptive yet inexhaustible.

## Usage Across CJKV Languages

**Japanese (こくあん, _kokuan_)**: 黒暗 in Japanese preserves all three dimensions - physical darkness, cosmological associations (especially in Buddhist contexts), and moral/spiritual darkness. The term appears in both classical Buddhist texts and modern usage.

**Korean (흑암, _heugam_)**: Similarly maintains the physical, cosmological, and moral-spiritual ranges. Buddhist texts use 흑암 for spiritual darkness/ignorance, while the term also describes physical darkness and metaphorical moral obscurity.

**Vietnamese (_hắc ám_ or _hắc ám_)**: Vietnamese usage emphasizes the physical and moral dimensions more strongly than the cosmological. The term commonly describes literal darkness and metaphorical "dark times" or evil, with Buddhist philosophical usage preserved in religious contexts.

## Related Concepts
黒暗 relates to: 玄 ("mysterious darkness"), 無明 ("ignorance"), 陰 (the dark/receptive principle), 光明 ("light/brightness"), and 混沌 ("primordial chaos/undifferentiation").
