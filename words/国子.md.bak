- **Original Zhouli sense**: “sons of the state” = princes, noble students.
- **Han–Tang onward**: “national students,” i.e. elite education.
- **Modern usage**: survives in the compound **國子監 (Imperial Academy)** across CJKV, especially as place names (Beijing, Hanoi, Seoul).
- The bare word **國子** by itself is **archaic**, but still transparent if you know the classical context.
