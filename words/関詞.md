## Notes
- This word ('relator') was chosen instead of the existing CJKV term 助詞.  This is because 助詞 has a variety of meaning.  We are taking the J/K meaning.  In Japanese, that term has many subcategories:
- 並立助詞 - parallel marker, 並詞
- 係助詞 - linking marker
- 副助詞 - adverbial marker
- 接続助詞 - conjunctive marker, 接助
- 格助詞 - case marker
- 準体助詞 - nominalizing marker
- 終助詞 - sentence ending marker
- 間投助詞 - interjection marker
